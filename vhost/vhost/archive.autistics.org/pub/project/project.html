Subject: Plots to take over the world: #1- a global database<BR>
Date: 98-10-28 05:10:28 EST</TT></P>


<P>
<TT>Well, okay, it's not a plot to take over the world. It's a plot to
make life a little easier for ACs in this world.</TT></P>
 

<P>
<TT>In the last few days, between this list and IRC, I've seen three
suicide threats/attempts by ACs. This is very sobering. It just
*shouldn't* be happening.</TT>  </P>
 

<P>
<TT>So I've been thinking of things to do about it.</TT></P>

<P>
<TT>=======================<BR>
PROJECT #1- What is it<BR>
=======================</TT></P>
 

<P>
<TT>My first idea is to create a global database for information useful
to ACs, controlled by ACs, created by ACs. The first two databases I
imagine building are a database of services for ACs by regions (or
lack thereof), WITH RATINGS; and a dating service.</TT></P>
 

<P>
<TT>There _are_ other database projects/meeting services, etc. with more
limited goals (one of which involves Martijn's mother, of all people
:)) I haven't contacted them yet, but obviously we should work
together with any other database projects we can find... perhaps by
providing the technical structure while other groups collect and
organize the information that interests them.</TT></P>
 

<P>
<TT>(Heh: move over, Medline. Next time, Nexus... :))</TT></P>
 

<P>
<TT>The database would be internet based but would make a deliberate
effort to reach out to ACs who don't have computer access, by working
with independent living centers and local autism groups to provide
offline access. In addition persons would be encouraged to use the
database to whatever extent they wanted within their own websites.</TT></P>
 

<P>
<TT>BTW: this is flexible and tentative: just a starting point for
ideas. I specifically *do not* want to make this "my" pet project
that I have exclusive control over. I *know* I'm capable but erratic-- 
if it depends only upon me it's doomed. Moreover "Laura's database"
isn't quite the same as a database for everyone.</TT></P>
 

<P><TT>
==================<BR>
What we need<BR>
==================</TT></P>
 

<P>
<TT>To pull this off we'd need HTML geeks, network geeks, and database
geeks on the team. One of the nice things about ACs is we have these
kinds of talents in abundance. We have three volunteers so far, of
the geek persuasion :-) More (esp. a database programmer or so) would
be useful.</TT></P>
 

<P>
<TT>We need a server, and ideally a domain. I think it may be possible to
find free server space, though if necessary we could find space on a
web hosting service that would do for starters for $10-40/month, USD.
The domain "autistics.org" is available; getting it costs $70.00
USD for two years.</TT></P>
 

<P>
<TT>Which brings up the question of fundraising. The sums involved are
not that big, but beyond what I, who live on $500-something a month,
can pull out of my pocket. I have no grantwriting or donation
collecting skills, and I have a suspicion these kind of skills are in
short supply among us :-) This is a place where a few NT sympathisers
might come in handy.</TT></P>

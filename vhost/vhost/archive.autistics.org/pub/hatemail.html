Subject: U suck<BR><BR>


Your pathetic. You take cheap shots at organizations<BR>
by making cartoons and placing their name on it on<BR>
your web site.<BR>
What are you gonna be next year, dyslexic? <BR>
Why don't you just be a anarchist and be done with it.<BR>
I feel sorry for the autistic adults that you have<BR>
brain washed...but I get a good laugh out of your<BR>
actions...so immature and so warped. I laugh at you<BR>
daily...well when I get bored and decide to check up<BR>
on your goals on your web site...fighting the parents<BR>
that are trying to bring you down...hahahha. I hope<BR>
you don't decide to produce any more of your species.<BR> 
You wish you were autistic. <BR>
If you were, you might have some importance in life.<BR>
You wouldn't know anything about metabolism or how the<BR>
current autistics suffer from ill health. The ones you<BR>
trick are not ill like the new autistics.<BR><BR>

Subject: I think I've read enough<br><br>

Amanda (I assume this is your name),<br><br>

    After reading through your website for the second time (once was not<br>
quite enough to absorb it all), I have come to the conclusion that you<br>
are a complete frickin' loon.  And not in the playful, fun way, in the<br>
way in which you need to be forcibly removed from society, as soon as<br>
possible.  I believe that you are a danger to this great society, and<br>
that if we can't quarantine you, then you need to be removed completely.<br><br>

    I suggest that you save us a lot of time, and do it yourself.  Shooting<br>
yourself in the head is as good a solution as I can figure.  Make sure<br>
you place the barrel in your mouth, pointing upwards.  That way your<br>
skull is completely by passed, and you are guaranteed to die.  This is a<br>
quick and painless way, but it will have to suffice until I can figure<br>
out a more painless way for you to rid the world of your presence.<br><br>

Just dropping a quick note.<br><br>

-Jas<br>

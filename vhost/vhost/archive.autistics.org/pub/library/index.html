Their most frequent reasons were that I was an adult or not a child, that I was intelligent or not stupid, that I had never had any help before so I didn't need it now, and that the way I lived was my own choice. When people had an illness that was undiagnosed, their first job should have been to find them a doctor who would diagnose it. Instead they used it against me, always insisting that if doctors said there was nothing wrong with me then there couldn't be. They would not help you unless you were already being helped. [...] Like other social workers, he said my wanting somebody to help me meant I wanted to be a child. I wanted to claim Disability Living Allowance. He said it was "only for disabled people." He read the forms and said, "I don't see why you think you can claim this." He said I wasn't entitled to it and refused to fill them in. I didn't know what more he must want.&quot;</td></tr>

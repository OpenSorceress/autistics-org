<h1>Apparent "Ignoring" of People</h1>
</div>

<p>
"Do you have a hearing problem?"  I was on break in class, and this was the first sentence I actually processed correctly.  At the time, I was not diagnosed with CAPD or any other hearing difficulty, and in fact my hearing is above average in acuity.  I was wary of the girl because she had been hostile in the past.</p>

<p>
I responded, "No, not exactly."</p>

<p>
"Then why didn't you hear me ask you a question, or are you just ignoring me?"</p>

<p>
I gave what was my standard answer for any "hearing problem" at the time, which stemmed from my schizophrenia diagnosis.  "I sometimes hear voices."  But I did not hear voices, and that was not the problem.  The girl was satisfied at my explanation, and pointed to another girl in the class.  "She hears voices a lot; why didn't you just say so?"</p>

<p>
I can't count the number of times people have said "Hello...", waved their hands in front of my face, or concluded me to be a "space case" because I did not hear what they were saying.  In Latin class in high school, this earned me the nicknames of "Exspatiata" (which is a more literal meaning of "spaced out") and "Alias alibi" (which means, in Latin, "otherwise elsewhere").</p>

<p>
If I do not hear or process speech, I can appear to be ignoring it.  This can occur when it is so distorted as to become meaningless, when it fades into the background, when I do not notice that it is language and meant to be interpreted, or in several other situations.  Usually I am not actively ignoring someone, but do sometimes appear to ignore people because their speech sounds meaningless.</p>

<h1>Autism, Speech, and Assistive Technology</h1>

<p>I walked into the autism center at my university, hoping that they would be
able to help me with many of the pressing problems in my life at the time --
many of which ultimately kept me from being able to attend university as it's currently set up, and
still keep me from living without assistance.  I carried a keyboard,
which I had obtained recently for the purpose of communication, because I
often have trouble with speech.</p>

<p>I can't remember if that was the day I spoke or the day I used the keyboard,
but I do remember one statement made by the local Autism Expert <SUP>TM</SUP>. 
&quot;Maybe we can help you reduce anxiety so you won't have to rely on your
keyboard.&quot;  That's when any remaining ideas in my mind that this person
was a real expert on autism fell apart.</p>

<p>I like my keyboard.  I've spent my whole life struggling with speech, and I
like to have an alternative means of communication.  I often feel more
comfortable when I use my keyboard, because it does not involve the painful
and complicated process of speech in addition to language.  My friends even
tell me I'm more spontaneous and expressive when I don't speak.  And here was
someone, supposed to be an expert in the field of autism (I've since learned
what autism &quot;expert&quot; means) telling me that if I reduced
&quot;anxiety&quot;, I wouldn't have to &quot;rely&quot; on this wonderful
device so much.</p>

<p>(As a note: my speech problems have little to do with anxiety.  I have
problems with speech and with expressive language in general.  Some are
intermittent, while others are constant.  This is different from anxiety,
although stress and anxiety certainly don't help any -- particularly, I might
add, stress that comes from dealing with autism &quot;experts&quot; who want to
take away my keyboard.)</p>

<p>I'm reminded here of people who use wheelchairs to get around.  Many get
upset if you refer to them as &quot;confined&quot; to a wheelchair.  To those
people, a wheelchair is freedom.  And to me, my keyboard means freedom.  I
don't &quot;rely&quot; on it -- I use it so I don't have to rely on
my limited speaking abilities.</p>

<p>I'm trying to picture someone who had a condition that made it painful
to walk all their life, but who managed to walk places for limited
distances but never enjoy it, finally being offered a wheelchair to get
around as an adult.  They could now go out and it would no longer be a
painful chore, but something they could maybe even begin to enjoy.  In
their place, I would be <em>glad</em> to have that new freedom.  That's
how I feel being offered assistive communications technology (i.e. my
keyboard).  I can enjoy things I could never fully enjoy before, because
of the emphasis on speech.  (I even more enjoy, a lot of the time, being
in a language-free environment, but so far I have no way of applying that
to everyday communication situations.)  The point is, I am now <em>more
free</em> than I was before -- I am no longer dependent or reliant on a
voice that works sporadically and often painfully.  And I <em>enjoy</em>
that freedom.</p>

<p>And here, again, was someone trying to take this freedom away from me, under
the assumption that if I could speak sometimes that I must always be able to
speak, and that the only thing that could prevent me from speaking would be
anxiety.  Not only that, but it assumed that speech must be my goal, that I
could not be happy without speaking, that I was comfortable when I did speak. 
Since I have never been particularly happy speaking, I find it difficult to
imagine that concept.  But there it is.</p>

<p>Why is speech supposed to be the ultimate goal of so many autism therapies? 
Because it is ingrained into so many neurotypicals that speech and language
are necessary to be whole, alive, and functioning as a human being.  I have
attended so many psychology and linguistics classes which put forth speech and
language as the only way to be a truly thinking being.  I must not be a truly
thinking being then, according to them, because I don't use language in my
head.</p>

<p>(When I point this out, of course, I am told that since I am using language
to communicate I am talking nonsense, or else that I am some kind of
&quot;exception&quot; who doesn't deserve mention in the class -- or in the
definition of &quot;thinking being&quot; for that matter.)</p>

<p>So language is extremely valuable to most neurotypicals, and speech in
particular.  Other modes of communication, when used by autistic people,
are still not usually &quot;good enough&quot; for such neurotypicals.  An
autistic woman making her needs known through ways other than speech, rather
than being congratulated on her ingenuity, is worried about by her teachers --
because she may not learn any new words if she can already communicate. 
Autistics successfully using pictures to communicate are also considered
&quot;not good enough&quot;, and speech and language are emphasized.  Autistics
using written, typed, or signed language are urged to speak, because speaking
is somehow considered &quot;better&quot; (I note this occurs a lot with deaf
people too).  Autistics who can speak sometimes but not others are urged to
speak all the time, and if they have difficulty when they do speak, that is
ignored.</p>

<p>In some cases, an autistic person may want to speak.  If that's so, then
they should be given every opportunity to learn.  However, a lot of us
have other ways of communicating.  With a keyboard to type on, I feel a lot
more free than I do talking or being expected to talk when I can't communicate adequately that way. 
There are other times when I can't use language at all, and I am having a
really hard time finding assistive technology to deal with that.  But the fact
that I am having a hard time finding that technology doesn't mean I
shouldn't.</p>  

<p>I have a right to communicate in whatever means is possible for me to
communicate (within the bounds of not hitting or throwing things at people,
although I've often had urges to do that to autism "experts".)  And not only
do I have that right, but I have the right to <em>choose</em> what means of
communication is appropriate for me.  If I am unable to speak, I should
certainly be given other options.</p>

<p>But also (and this is what a lot of people, even those who get that
first part, miss) if I am able to speak but it is painful, difficult, and
draining, I should also be given and allowed those other options.  People
have a right not to just be alive, but be able, to paraphrase a famous
document, to pursue their own happiness.  That is, people have a right to
not only have enough assistance to stay alive and function minimally in
the world, but to enjoy being alive as well.</p>

<p>I have rarely, if ever, been unhappy directly because of trouble speaking.
 I have quite often been unhappy because of not having those other options for
communication (not being able to communicate can <em>definitely</em> be
frustrating!), and because of all the assumptions that caused that not to
happen for so long.  And I am still unhappy to see that the first order of
business for &quot;helping&quot; an autistic is so often to attempt to take
those options away.</p>

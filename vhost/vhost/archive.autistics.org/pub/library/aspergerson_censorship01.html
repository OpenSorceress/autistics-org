<h3>Censorship &amp; Banning of Autistic Canadians jypsy (janet norman-bain) and Michelle Dawson by Aspergers Society of Ontario (jypsy Correspondence)</h3>

<p><small>(Mirror of <a href="http://www.neurodiversity.com/aspergerson_censorship01.html">http://www.neurodiversity.com/aspergerson_censorship01.html</a>)</small></p>


<p class="article">On Saturday, October 30, 2004, jypsy (janet norman-bain), Aspie mother of four children (one autistic, one Asperger's, two neurotypical), and proprietor of the world-renowned website, <a class="sidebar" href="http://www.isn.net/~jypsy/" target="_new">Ooops...Wrong Planet! Syndrome</a>, posted an announcement of the availability of autistic researcher Michelle Dawson's essay, <a class="sidebar" href="http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_ascd.html" target="_new">Autism Society Canada's "Proactive Approach": Evidence for a Communication Disorder</a> to the Yahoo! mailing list <a class="sidebar" href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/aspergerson/" target="_new">Aspergerson</a>. The essay is a report of a number of interactions between Ms. Dawson and officials of the Autism Society of Canada, pertaining to ASC policies and governance. The announcement post consisted of a title, a link, and a brief quote.</p>

<p class="article">According to its mission statement, the <a class="sidebar" href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/aspergerson/" target="_new">Aspergerson</a> list, sponsored by the <a class="sidebar" href="http://www.aspergers.ca/" target="_new">Aspergers Society of Ontario</a>, "was created to serve as a meeting place for those affected by Asperger's Syndrome in the province of Ontario. All topics related to Asperger's Syndrome are open for discussion (examples - new research, programming, support, medication, navigating the social services and education systems, and adults with Asperger's)... Membership in the Aspergers Society of Ontario is not required in order to join this group." jypsy joined the Aspergerson list on Octobrer 2, 2002. Michelle Dawson joined the list on September 21, 2004, after becoming apprised of <a class="sidebar" href="aspergerson_censorship02.html">personally derogatory list postings</a>.</p>

<p class="article">On Monday, November 1, 2004, Margot Nelles, President and CEO of Aspergers Society of Ontario, emailed Ms. norman-bain to inform her that she had been banned from the Aspergerson list. Ms. Michelle Dawson then posted to the list an announcement of the availability of her latest essay, <a class="sidebar" href="http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_ascd.html" target="_new">We Are Not Your Community: In Response to Autism Society Canada's Open Letter</a>. Like jypsy's announcement, this post also consisted of a title, a link, and a brief quote. Within an hour, Ms. Dawson received an email from Ms. Nelles informing her that she, too, had been permanently banned from the mailing list.</p>

<p class="article">The following is the exchange of correspondence between Margot Nelles and jypsy (janet norman-bain), pertaining to Ms. Nelles' censorship and public disparagement of Ms. norman-bain.

<p class="article">Janet,</p>

<p class="article">I have made the difficult decision to restrict you from the Aspergers Ontario Listserve, as of today. </p>

<p class="article">On at least two previous occasions, I have sent messages to the list asking members to refrain from derogatory remarks about individuals in the autism community and other autism-related organizations. In part your posts necessitated this request. Your post Saturday, which provided the link to Michelle Dawson's website and her most recent article on Autism Society Canada and their Executive Director, does not meet this standard. </p>

<p class="article">You have also received numerous messages from members on the Aspergers Ontario listserve about your posts. They have asked you to refrain from negative and critical judgments about others in our community. They are of the opinion that such posts are not in the spirit of cooperation and collaboration that we want to foster in our community.</p>

<p class="article">The Aspergers Society of Ontario is committed to working with other autism-related organizations and developing partnerships with them. Even though we may have differences of opinion as to how to support each other, I believe that we always need to remain respectful of others and endeavour to understand their points of view.</p>

<p class="article">Finally, I would like to remind you of the purpose of the Aspergers Ontario Listserve: "Aspergers Ontario was created to serve as a meeting place for those affected by Asperger Syndrome in the province of Ontario. All topics related to Asperger Syndrome are open for discussion (examples - new research, programming, support, medication, navigating the social services and education systems, and adults with Asperger's)." </p>

<p class="article">It just dawned on me that you are absolutely correct. I am new at the technical aspects of the list and didn t realize that you would not be able to see the postings or responses. If you would like, I will take off the ban command to enable you to see and/or post if you choose. However, the moderated command will remain and all postings from members will still have to be approved.</p>

<p class="article">Many of your postings have been quite useful and encouraging (to me anyway) and of course your web site is one of the resources that I do give out to parents and professionals as it is such an extensive listing of resources in the community. </p>

<p class="article">Regardless of how you may perceive our group to be, there is an understanding of the issues that you and Michelle (and many others as well) are fighting to change, as we are fighting the same battle, just on a different field and we must remain non-partisan in our efforts. This is one of the reasons why we also do not post items from other organizations, unless they pertain to informational sessions, conferences etc. </p>

<p class="article">We here on PEI don't have a "real" Aspergers Society. Parents of Aspies first got together a couple of years ago, the meeting was initiated and facilitated by Marlene Breitenbach, Special Education Autism Consultant at the School Board and I was invited more as the resident adult Aspie than parent of one. It was a good meeting, The Aspergers_Society_of_PEI Yahoo list came out of it but not much more. Some of the Summerside parents got together a few times since. I run the list, our description is this (I didn't write it):</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>The Aspergers Society of Prince Edward Island is a group of people dedicated to helping people, including professionals, who seek information on Asperger's Syndrome to learn all they can, while providing province-wide support to people with Aspergers and those that care about them. If you are lucky enough to have Aspergers in your life, or wish to learn more, we welcome your participation. We are a non-judgmental group, everyone has a right to say what they think, but please, think about what you say!</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">The list has worked well, without *any* problem at all, since April 2002. </p>

<p class="article">Monday afternoon, the following was posted on The Aspergers_Society_of_PEI Yahoo list:</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>Just wanted to say I like these articles of information you're sending out. Thanks, and keep them
coming.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">To which I replied:</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>I'm glad you appreciate them and though you appear to be from Ontario I'm afraid you'll have to stick to this list to read them - the Autism Ontario list refuses to post them and today the Aspergerson List (Aspergers Ontario) *banned* both Michelle Dawson and I for posting these articles. (Except for once about 8 years ago when Lenny Schafer flipped out and kicked me off the FEAT list and then invited me back on I've never been kicked off a list let alone banned. I was not put on moderated status, just banned)</i><br>

<p class="article">To which he replied (in part):</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>I live in Ontario but I'm not FROM Ontario. I'm a member of the Ontario ASO but other then get a few newsletters I don't get much out of it really.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">Beyond the obvious irony of the situation I can't help but think there's a lesson here. I don't know whether he's an Aspie or a parent (I do know he's married) but whatever his situation he is better "served" by what we are offering than what Ontario has to offer. </p>

<p class="article">I truly appreciate your input. This has been quite a learning experience for me personally and while I was taken aback at some of the notes sent to me, I also can appreciate the reasons behind them. </p>

<p class="article">I m glad that your list in PEI is working for those across Canada (I'm sure there are others outside PEI that are members) and again, I appreciate your work in providing the amazing resources on your web. They have certainly helped a great many people find the support that they need. </p>

<p class="article">I'm also sure that as we move along there will be others that are less than impressed with what we (the Society) do. Thinking that we will be able to please everyone that comes across our organization is rather unrealistic. We do our best to provide a service and when that falls short of what an individual is looking for, I m glad to know that they have a choice and can seek out the missing piece from the lists, web sites etc that you, Michelle and others provide.</p>

Subject: [aspergerson] Recent Changes and Reasons Why<br>
To: aspergerson@yahoogroups.com<br>
</h4>

<p class="article">You may have noticed the recent changes that have been made to our group list. We are posting this to explain these changes and why we feel that they are necessary. </p>

<p class="article">Despite what we feel have been clear requests to refrain from angry postings that attack specific individuals or organizations, such items have continued to appear on our list. This is problematic, as the Aspergers Society has always operated as a non-partisan organization. Although we may have strong opinions regarding the work being done in our community, we have endeavored to share these with others in a respectful way. </p>

<p class="article">As a group of individuals affected in some way by Asperger syndrome, we also have the opportunity to learn from others' experiences and perspectives. We all greatly value this. Such learning and understanding best occurs in an environment of understanding, respect and cooperation.</p>

<p class="article">Our belief is that in order for us to meet our goals and be successful as an organization we must work within the community as a 
whole, not attacking the aspects of it that may not be to the liking of us individually, or of our members. We feel that working in this manner increases our chances of evoking positive change and dispelling the myths around autism and Asperger Syndrome that 
prevail in our society. As an organization we continually see systemic barriers that lead to the marginalization of individuals with Asperger Syndrome, which must be cooperatively addressed. We do believe that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."</p>

<p class="article">The Aspergerson listserve was created with the intention of providing a place for people to connect and find support. It is a place for people to share success stories, information, resources and strategies. It is a place for people with Asperger Syndrome, their families and other concerned individuals to come together in a positive way and try to bring each other hope. It was never intended to be an arena for political debate, or a forum for publicly criticizing parents, professionals or other organizations in the community. </p>

<p class="article">The steps we are taking now to better monitor the list should have been put in place from the beginning. All postings must now be approved by the moderator before going to the list. Though this may seem like censorship to some, we feel it is in the best interest of the list, its members and the Society as a whole. As well, the description of the group will change to reflect our policy and hopefully give a clear sense of what our list is all about to avoid any confusion for current and future members. This decision was not made lightly and after considerable discussion and feedback from members of the list.</p>

<p class="article">Please remember that the Asperger Society is still a developing agency run entirely by volunteers. <a class="sidebar" href="aspergerson_censorship03.html">There has never been any core funding for the Society. There are no salaries.</a> There is no office. We depend upon a handful of dedicated individuals to help us realize our vision. We hope that those involved with our Society will be supportive of us as we continue to grow and develop.</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>You may have noticed the recent changes that have been made to our group list. We are posting this to explain these changes and why we feel that they are necessary.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">I wish you had mentioned that you had banned Michelle and I and explained your reasoning. I wish you had sent me a copy of this and I didn't need to depend on a listmember to forward it to me.</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>Despite what we feel have been clear requests to refrain from angry postings that attack specific individuals or organizations, such items have continued to appear on our list.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">I have gone back through many, many, many posts and I cannot find an "angry" posting from me to aspergerson. </p>

<p class="article">but this:</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>"Enough already! You make me very angry because I waste my precious time reading stuff that has no substance to whatever you are trying to inflict. How about having a son with Tourette's, Aspergers and psychosis!? No, I'm not going to be gentle or diplomatic. I think you should be told."</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">That person is "angry", that is an "angry posting", that was NOT me. But what of the people like S[...] who sit back and appreciate my postings? Just because a vocal couple object you assume the majority do and silence me? Must everyone be like the guy from Ontario on the PEI list who posts just to say 'thanks and keep them coming'?</p>

<p class="article">I'm also not "attacking" individuals or organizations. ASC is surely being criticized and deservedly so. Derogatory terminology will be addressed wherever it comes from, whoever spouts it. The petitions I posted did not attack "individuals" they both addressed dangerous, sensationalist and false statements made by people. In the case of one I also posted a letter from one of the people named in the petition who was in agreement with the petition and agreed to refrain from ever using the terminology again. </p>

<p class="article">The other problem would be your idea of "clear requests". You posted the following:</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>To: aspergerson@yahoogroups.com<br>
Subject: [aspergerson] List Serve Etiquette</i></blockquote>

<blockquote class="article"><i>Dear List Members</i></blockquote>

<blockquote class="article"><i>I hope everyone enjoyed their summer and those that have returned to school are off to a good start. As the current list moderator, I would like to make a few comments.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote class="article"><i>This list was started so that those with AS, their family members, or anyone else interested in AS could have a place to go to receive information on resources, new developments, and upcoming events as well as discuss supports and strategies for success. This list was not created as a political platform or as a place to attack professionals or other agencies working in the field of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The Asperger Society of Ontario and, I believe it's members, wants to form cooperative relationships with other agencies and professionals that have dedicated their time and energies to finding the best way to support Autism/AS. We endevour to create cooperative dialogue and change unhelpful attitudes and myths along the way.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote class="article"><i>I would ask that those who wish to criticize, or attack what organizations or professionals are doing, refrain from doing so, and that we treat others in our community respectfully. Those who do not or cannot respect the purpose and spirit of this list will be asked to leave.</i></blockquote>

You didn't ever answer my questions though, you very rarely ever do (and despite pointing it out to you, you still don't: Date: Tue, 21 Sep 2004 "Is there a reason you are engaging in dialogue with B[...], S[...], L[...], but not me? I have put forth my ideas to you but "discussion" is a 2 way street. -jypsy").</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>This is problematic, as the Aspergers Society has always operated as a non-partisan organization. Although we may have strong opinions regarding the work being done in our community, we have endeavored to share these with others in a respectful way.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote class="article"><i>As a group of individuals affected in some way by Asperger syndrome, we also have the opportunity to learn from others' experiences and perspectives. We all greatly value this. Such learning and understanding best occurs in an environment of understanding, respect and cooperation.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">Like the Aspergers Society of PEI list?</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>Our belief is that in order for us to meet our goals and be successful as an organization we must work within the community as a whole, not attacking the aspects of it that may not be to the liking of us individually, or of our members.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">maintain the status quo, never question authority etc..... Don't criticize lest it be called "attacking" and you be labeled "angry" (especially if your calm logic provokes anger in others...)</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>We feel that working in this manner increases our chances of evoking positive change and dispelling the myths around autism and Asperger Syndrome that prevail in our society.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">And how does silencing us fit into those plans? Do we not fit the model you want to project? An autistic *has* gone to The Supreme Court. This Aspie has set a president in PEI's Disability Support Program that made computers eligible for funding. Alex finished 27th out of 443 in the PEI half marathon. Given the chance you'de be surprised what we can do. Given the chance.....</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>As an organization we continually see systemic barriers that lead to the marginalization of individuals with Asperger Syndrome, which must be cooperatively addressed.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">How are you cooperatively addressing this recent issue? Although Michelle is autistic, I'm an Aspie and if I haven't just been marginalized by your organization's systemic barrier then I'd like to know how you'de define it. </p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>We do believe that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">meaning? </p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>The Aspergerson listserve was created with the intention of providing a place for people to connect and find support.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">"Support" is not in the group's description. The list's description makes it look *far* more like an "information sharing" group than a "support group". If it was created with that intention why was that not stated in it's description? (I would draw your attention again to the description of the Aspergers Society of PEI description at <a class="sidebar" href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Aspergers_Society_of_PEI/" target="_new">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Aspergers_Society_of_PEI/</a>, "support" is in there)</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>It is a place for people to share success stories, information, resources and strategies.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">"All topics related to Asperger's Syndrome are open for discussion (examples - new research, programming, support, medication, navigating the social services and education systems, and adults with Asperger's)."</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>It is a place for people with Asperger Syndrome, their families and other concerned individuals.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">"Individuals with or without a diagnosis, parents, family members, professionals, and educators are invited to join"</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>to come together in a positive way</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">It doesn't say that, again one can see the positive inference at <a class="sidebar" href=
"http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Aspergers_Society_of_PEI/" target="_new">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Aspergers_Society_of_PEI/</a></p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>and try to bring each other hope.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">"try to bring each other hope"??!! That doesn't sound very positive, sounds a little desperate to me. That's sad.</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>It was never intended to be an arena for political debate, or a forum for publicly criticizing parents, professionals or other organizations in the community.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">never intended or not allowed to be?</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>The steps we are taking now to better monitor the list should have been put in place from the beginning.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">As should a proper description for the list, especially if you are going to ban people without moderating them or without truly giving "clear requests".</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>All postings must now be approved by the moderator before going to the list. Though this may seem like censorship to some, we feel it is in the best interest of the list, its members and the Society as a whole.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">And you banned Michelle and I from the list. You are not treating your list members with respect by making them all go through you. You seem to be taking out your problems with Michelle & I on everyone there. I don't see how you can possibly think this kind of behaviour is in the best interest of your list and the Society as a whole. </p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>As well, the description of the group will change to reflect our policy and hopefully give a clear sense of what our list is all about to avoid any confusion for current and future members. This decision was not made lightly and after considerable discussion and feedback from members of the list.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">what considerable discussion and feedback from which select members of the list? The feedback I'm getting (aside from G[...]'s) is that listmembers find this whole situation quite "sureal".</p>

<blockquote class="article"><i>Please remember that the Asperger Society is still a developing agency run entirely by volunteers. There has never been any core funding for the Society. There are no salaries. There is no office. We depend upon a handful of dedicated individuals to help us realize our vision. We hope that those involved with our Society will be supportive of us as we continue to grow and develop.</i></blockquote>

<p class="article">Please remember that no one will ever hold the opinions of list members on a Yahoo list "sponsored by the Aspergers Society of Ontario" where "Membership in the ASO is not required for joining this group" to be the opinions of the Aspergers Society of Ontario. You are not endorsing us by allowing us to post (just as you are not endorsing http://www.fastacnerelief.com though you allowed their acne treatment post and have their link in your link section or the debt service post http://grealus.com/adeh1 you allowed) but you are censoring us when you ban us from the list and say we were given "clear requests". </p>

<p class="article">I could do amazing things with "a handful of dedicated individuals" and the sponsors you have but it's just me and the costs come out of my pocket. My website does not censor the view I don't like - perhaps that's part of what makes it valuable to you. My site now has 413 different pages..... imagine how few it would have if I started taking down all the pages I don't agree with - my aba page, my chelation page, etc etc. I believe in choice and making educated decisions about those choices. One can't make those educated decisions without all the facts though. The comment was made (by P[...]) "I do not think that I should be scared away from a society or agency because of someone else's expereince." but the same can be said if someone were to praise an organization - "I don't think I should be convinced to trust a society or agency because of someone else's experience." We're adults, we need to make our own decisions and judgement calls based on all the info we can get our hands on. If P[...] is so easily swayed by the opinions of others that she would be scared away from something by someone else's experience *that problem* is hers, not other list members. I don't see it as the moderators job to protect people who can't think for themselves. </p>

<p class="article">I am utterly amazed at the lengths you have gone to to silence Michelle's work. Perhaps if you had taken the time to reply to my questions on the list we would never be here now. </p>

<p class="article">I just thought it should be known that even when I don't reply, there are times I go out of my way to look into things for folks on the Aspergerson list. I checked out with J[...] (and his girlfriend T[...] and through him his room mates and RCC college friends) both the question of karaoke and tutors that was raised on the list. J[...]'s replies (basically "sorry, can't help") were on MSN chat and I can't locate them at the moment to show you. </p>

Do anything for you or anyone you know? The kid is an Aspie....<br>
Hi<br> 
Does anyone have any idea where to find tutors? I am still looking for someone to help my daughter with all those organizational things that get in her way at school - like taking notes, making an outline, keeping an agenda etc.<br>
But all I can find are people who teach academic subjects - which we don't need.<br>
I'm also trying to find people who can work one to one with her on her topics of interest. At her age, 13, I realize she no longer wants to be in Camps and group activities, she just wants help to pursure her interests and she knows exactly what her interests are and where she wants to go with them-<br>
computer programmng (visual basic, java, html), computer animation (Flash), web design (dreamweaver), video production and computer music. There just aren't any classes I can find for her age at the level she wants to learn so I am looking for individuals whp can teach to her interests, at her pace, and with respect to her learning problems.<br>
The only place that is right for her is Real Programming 4 Kids but they are unvelievably expensive (but worth it if you can afford it).<br> 
I have no idea if such people exist or where I could find them<br> 
If I could find a student with the computer skills, I'm sure I could train them to work with her- but, perhaps, a students with those particular interests and skills might just get along her fine!<br> 
(we are looking in the Toronto area)<br> 
Thanks<br>

<p class="article">As much as I am quite thoroughly disgusted with your actions, my heart and my work is in the best interest of the autistic population. I don't believe your actions represent the views of the majority of the list and even if they did, my heart and work remains focused in the same place. Therefore, in the interest of the autistic (AS) population represented by your list, the members who are on the spectrum and the kids whose parents may need it and now find they cannot access it, I am offering to try to help you set the list up the way (I feel) you really want it set up.</p>

<p class="article">Obviously I'm not going to take all that time here to give you the step by step directions if you're not interested, but if you are, just ask.</p>

<p class="article">Hi Janet;</p>

<p class="article">Thank you for your offer. I thought I had set it up in that manner. For instance, I made a fwd post a few minutes ago from a few members that emailed me. When I posted to the site, I received a message such as the one you described stating that I had a message in need of approval. I m not sure what I am doing incorrectly. I have set the commands to notify me when a message is posted and I can t for the life of me find the place where I can modify the parameters so that anyone can post to the group and have the notification sent on to me. Any help in this area again would be appreciated. </p>

<h1>Distortion of Incoming Speech</h1>
</div>

<p>
CAPD causes incoming speech to sound distorted sometimes.  This can range from people sounding as if they are "talking backwards", to more simple things like confusion over letters, blurring together of sounds, or things otherwise "sounding wrong".  Sometimes things sound like a foreign language or "gibberish".</p>

<p>
Sometimes, with my hyperacuity to sound, sound distorts in much the same way that will happen if you take a cheap speaker, attach it to a stereo system or something of the like, and turn the volume up very high.  This will cause a "flattening" of the sound, an inability to discriminate the words, and a general lack of tonal complexity.</p>

<p>
This can make comprehension, depending on the sort of distortion, either difficult, spotty, or impossible.</p>

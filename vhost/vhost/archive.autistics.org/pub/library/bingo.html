<h1>Curebie Bingo</h1>

<p>Are you sitting in another Internet flamewar on the subject of cure, wondering whether you just want to give up trying to prove you're a worthwhile person as you are?  Tired of sitting through long-winded speeches on how horrible autism is and how much it needs to be eradicated?  Generally bored with and depressed by these discussions, but unable to get out of them for some reason?  Increasingly frustrated by your inability to come up with words in response to illogical but highly disturbing replies about how autism needs to be destroyed?</p>

<p>If you come from a strongly anti-cure perspective with regards to autism and need a way to pass your time in these situations, then <strong>Curebie Bingo</strong> may be for you.  It gives you something to do other than sit there and stew, and it can make you laugh instead of bash your head on things.  Best of all, you get to shout (or loudly type or think, for those who don't talk) &quot;BINGO!&quot; in the middle of these speeches, debates, books and other cure-related events.  (You may or may not want to explain yourself, however, in order to show that you're not just agreeing with whatever the last person said.  But be aware that a lot of people may find this game offensive at best.)</p>

<p>I have not made any of the quotes on the cards up.  They are all quotes or paraphrases from real discussions I have either participated in or witnessed with cure-oriented folks.  Note that <a href="bingo/card-03.jpg">Card 3</a> is a card specifically for use around autistic curebies.  The blank card allows you to fill in your own.</p>

<p>My advice for using these cards would be as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download one or more cards</li>
<li>Print one or more cards out, at around a 6-inch (15.24 centimeter) width.</li>
<li><em>(Optional)</em> Glue or otherwise affix the card to cardboard, construction paper, or something else sturdy.</li>
<li>Play Bingo.  If you get bored with the usual five-in-a-row strategy, you can find a list of other configurations at <a href="http://www.freebingogames.org/game-rules.html">Rules for the Game of Bingo</a>.</li>
<li>There is no prize, so far.  Only the satisfaction in converting an unpleasant emotional experience to at least a tolerable one, and in having a reason to yell &quot;BINGO!&quot; at random.</li>
</ol>

<p>Suggested rule:  You can mark two parts of your card at once if you hear a compound statement, but you can't mark two parts of your card at once if you hear a statement that seems to fit more than one part of the card.  If you hear &quot;I took my dog for a drive&quot;, you <em>cannot mark both</em> &quot;I took my dog in the car&quot; and &quot;I drove my dog somewhere&quot;.  But if you hear &quot;I took my dog for a drive and then we took a walk in the park,&quot; you <em>can perfectly well</em> mark both &quot;I drove my dog somewhere&quot; and &quot;I walked my dog in the park&quot;.</p>

<p>The following cards are just to start with.  Hopefully a wider range will be offered soon.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="bingo/card-blank.jpg">Blank Card</a> (103 KB)</li>
<li><a href="bingo/card-01.jpg">Card 1</a> (337 KB)</li>
<li><a href="bingo/card-02.jpg">Card 2</a> (359 KB)</li>
<li><a href="bingo/card-03.jpg">Card 3</a> (377 KB) &mdash; special card for autistic curebies</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope that this game serves its purpose:  To allow a needed humor break for anti-cure people (especially but I suppose not limited to autistics) in the middle of tiresome and depressing discussions.  My life has led me to develop a twisted sense of humor, which leads to me doing things like <em>this</em> when I have too much time on my hands.  ;-)</p>

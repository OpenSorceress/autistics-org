<h1>Difficulty Discriminating Sounds</h1>
</div>

<p>
I cannot always discriminate between various sounds and words.  I can wind up thinking that someone said something quite different than what they actually said, because I heard the sounds wrong.  This leads to difficulty with some forms of foreign (or even local) accents because of a tendency for sounds to be different depending on the accent.</p>

<p>
Right now, I can remember an incident in which I innocently thought that someone was speaking of finding a "boob" (which is slang for "breast", although I did not know it at the time) next to a river, instead of finding a "boot" as they were saying.</p>

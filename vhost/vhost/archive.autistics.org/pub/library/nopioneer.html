<H1>I Dont Want To Be A Pioneer I Just Want To Be Me</H1>



<P>
The role of being a pioneer is one that I imagine that many people within the autistic spectrum have taken especially those who are generally referred as having high functioning autism, probably not through choice but out of necessity. What exactly do I mean when I say that we are pioneers? I mean that due to either the ignorance relating to autism or an inadequate and prejudiced perception of the spectrum we are left in the position of both having to educate people about autism and give positive examples of what you can achieve in society if you have autistic traits.</P>


<P>
Personally I find the basic stumbling block on which all the others issues stems is the assumption most Neurotypical people have that Neurotypical worldview is neutral and normative. The Neurotypical world is presented as a given. I would be very surprised if many would be aware of it being an issue. Autism is then seen in contrast to this given, natural, neutral and normal society. The person with autism is then judged on his or her ability to conform to the values and standards of society. </P>


<P>
The person with autism goes through life engaging in systems which were designed for Neurotypicals, where the displaying of autistic traits is seen as negative or wrong, and where much of the communication is indecipherable for a vast number of autistic people. The fact that a number of autistic people are seriously underachieving is then interpreted to the deficits and impairments of the autistic person. If the person has not received a diagnosis of autism the emphasis is clearly on the deficits of the autistic person. The message is clear that if you which to succeed you have to learn art of being like Neurotypical. Considering the neutrality, given-ness and normality of Neurotypical society the system should not and cannot change. To challenge the nature of the systems displays a character flaw. In terms of my own experience this is most clear in terms of job interviews, where my autistic traits are most evident. </P>


<P>
The autistic person is then in the position of being in a society which does not understand autism and where the defining of autism are controlled by those who have regularly not helped the position of autistic people and indeed much of the time have hindered them. The autistic person is then placed in position of how to cope within such a society. There are numerous solutions some which are better for the person than others. Many are forced to take the pioneer role.</P>


<P>
We are faced with trying to succeed in dysfunctional systems where if we fail it is due to are failings and never due to the failings of the systems and where so often are strengths are not seen as strengths but as weaknesses. </P>


<P>
We are expected to inform and instruct people about are traits, but they are not expected to learn for themselves. We are expected to show how society is not neutral and is often disabling, and that if we are expected to live in society, society must change. To do so, involves risks - we can become a threat if try to say that there are flaws with the practice and theory of their society. The flaws might be thrust back on to us - we are trying to find excuses for our deficiencies. The role of educating people also requires a great deal of effort and energy often with very little positive response. </P>


<P>
We often have enough to deal with living a world which is not designed for us and having to deal with people who think that they understand autism for us to deal with role of pioneer. It is time for neurological typicals to understand by themselves with a true sense of humility.</P>

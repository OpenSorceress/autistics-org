Perspective," Proceedings of <I>Autism Europe's 6<SUP>th</SUP>
International Congress</I>, Glasgow 19-21 May 2000, in print.</P>

<H2>Theory of Mind</H2>

<P>Ladies and Gentlemen,<BR>

<BR>this presentation is the result of a discussion on Theory
of Mind (<ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM>) we had
on an electronic mailing list, the ANI-list. To understand
the character of this discussion, it is important to know
a bit about mailing lists in general and specifically about
the ANI-list.</P>

<P>A mailing list allows you to have group discussions
via e-mail. Everything you send to the list address gets
automatically sent to every member of the list, and of
course you also get everything written by other list-members
yourself. Often a discussion starts between two people, but
after a while others step in and keep the discussion going.</P>

<P>The ANI-list, the mailing list of Autism Network
International, is a list mainly for autistic people or
"cousins," i.e. people with autism-related conditions, although
the list is also open to other people. Its a private list,
which means that membership must be approved by one of the
list-owners, and it's not allowed to share posts from the list
with people who are not list-members without permission of
the author. In our presentation, we will only quote posts from
people who have agreed to this, and we will use either their
full name or just the first name or a nick name according
to their wishes. The quotes are unaltered, but we made some
changes in the sequence and added some parts. The authors who
contributed to this discussion are Jared Blackburn, Niki L,
Katja Gottschewski, Elsa George, Jane Meyerding, Jean
Miller, Patricia Clark, and Hal.</P>

<P>On the ANI-list and also in this discussion, some terms are
used which need explanation. One of those is the gender neutral
pronoun, "xe," "xyr" or "xem," which was originally used to
refer to an intersexed person, but is also used to refer to
a person of any gender. People also often refer to "ACs" and
"NTs." "AC" stands for "autistic or cousin," meaning a person
on the autistic spectrum in a wide sense. "NT" stands for
"neurotypical," i.e. a person with typical neurology, or a
"normal" person. All people involved in this discussion on
<ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM> are ACs.</P>

<P>Elsa George started the discussion raising some
questions about the term "Theory of Mind," and how the word
"mind" is used in this context:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I have just picked up a book by Uta Frith and have come
across something called "theory of mind."</P>

<P>Does anyone know what she is talking about? It seems Uta
Frith is implying there is some mysterious, non physical 
"mind" in each of us, separate from the brain.  I have
read some philosophical neuroscience books on the "mind,"
where I have gathered they mean self-consciousness. The
general direction this field is going is towards the mind
being a direct result of the brain (something to do with
communication between right and left hemispheres).</P>

<P>However I don't think this is what she means as she
uses it to explain things like not being able to understand
deceit. Which sounds more to me like a combination of logical
reasoning and empathy (in which case I would say my theory
of mind is intact). However, I also get the feeling I may
have totally missed the point (not meaning I don't have one,
I just failed to understand her distinction between mind
and brain).</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Jared then talked about the meaning of the term
"Theory of Mind," as it is used by Uta Frith and others,
and pointed out that it is in fact a rather vague term and
used inconsistently:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>To me, mind is pattern - like the attractors of chaos theory
- it is a pattern of biological states and actions (with their
associated subjective experience).  I don't think that Uta is
really talking about what "mind" is though, but only
with the intuitive understanding that it (i.e., something like
"that") exists.  She is not really talking about mind itself,
but the intuitive (and automatic) assumption that one exists
in people.  By this, she basically seems to be talking about
the realizing that others (and ourselves) have their own
thoughts, feeling, perception, beliefs, and so forth - as
opposed to thinking one's own "mental" experience was identical
to objective reality, and separate part of the world itself.
Thus, she would say that someone without <ACRONYM TITLE="Theory
of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM> would think that a person who knows the
rock is under shell x, would not realize they <EM>knew</EM>
it was "there," only that it <EM>was</EM> there, and assume
everyone should act according to it being "there."  A person
with <ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM>, on the
other hand, would realize that not everyone would know it was
there, because the knowing was part of xyr own experience, not
available to everyone - i.e., it was in their "mind," not just
"so."  I don't think that whether a mind is biological action,
a ghost, or whatever is really relevant to the "Theory of Mind"
or Uta's hypothesis about the "Theory of Mind."  (Note: "Theory
of Mind" is not itself a scientific theory, it's a construct,
like gravity, a name for an abstract concept - I'm not sure if
Uta has bothered to name her theory <EM>about</EM> <ACRONYM
TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM> - Uta is not suggesting
<ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM> itself as a
theory, but is assuming every NT adult has this idea anyway
- she is proposing a theory about <ACRONYM TITLE="Theory
of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM> not working in ACs.) In my opinion,
"ghosts" have no place in science, it's not scientists job
to argue against them - that's religion.  But, I don't think
Uta is talking about "ghosts."</P>

<P>Researchers have a lot of inconsistency in their use
of the term "Theory of Mind" - <CITE>Simon Baron-Cohen and
John Swettenham (1997) [<A NAME="1b" HREF="#1a">1</A>]</CITE> and Uta
Frith seem to define it as above when explaining it, but their research
often seems to be on totally unrelated (or only vaguely related)
concepts. Thus it is misleading - they prove one thing or
another called "Theory of Mind" is missing, and then report
their results in terms of a totally different idea. And
since they use terms like "theory of mind" and "mind blind"
(that are catchy in media) they get a lot of unwarranted
attention - and a lot of misleading ideas about autism get
propagated. Uta's stimuli test all sort of things (one set
was just an emotional expression reading test). She seems to
have habits of changing definitions, making huge (il)logical
jumps, and often has subtle circular reasoning. So, in a way,
it's hard to really be sure what she's talking about, since
she really isn't that consistent.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>While the term "Theory of Mind" is already vague, there
are still more problems with some tests which are supposed
to test "Theory of Mind," as Jared pointed out:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Others have noted that, besides often testing a totally
different construct, many "Theory of Mind" tests used by
researchers depend on verbal ability, attention, information
processing, and other capabilities that may be impaired in
the subjects.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In the following, we discuss one specific <ACRONYM
TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM> test, the
Sally-Anne-test. In this test, the child gets to see two
dolls, Sally and Anne. Sally puts a marble into a basket
and then leaves the room. Anne enters the room, takes the
marble out of the basket and puts it into a box. The child
then gets asked where Sally would look for the marble when
she comes back to the room. It is seen as a sign of <ACRONYM
TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM> if the child understands
that Sally doesn't know what Anne knows, and therefore answers
that Sally will look in the basket where she put the marble
herself. Niki L commented on this:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I believe that I had some sort of theory of mind problem
myself when I was younger, but the problems I had were
something that Sally Anne test cannot show. What you can detect
by Sally Anne test is lack of "theory of others' knowledge,"
not lack of "theory of mind" in general. I had theory of
others' knowledge when I was very young, possibly I might
even have attained it earlier than many NT kids. However,
my theory of others' knowledge had an awry exception, and
I completely lacked "theory of people's (including my own)
will and decision making." It seems to me that theory of mind
is too broad an idea to describe the problem I had, because
the term "mind" includes several different concepts.</P>

<P>If there were some other test about people's decision
making, I would not have been able to pass until I reached
preadolescence, but it was not because of ignorance,
but because of over-adherence to "false theory of others'
decision making," something similar to determinism, which I
had formed when I had been very young, reasoning by analogy of
TV program timetables I saw on newspapers, train timetables,
weekly lunch menu at nursery school, and so on. I assumed
that everything is predetermined and that adults were taking
care of us according to some sort of program, without their
own decision making. That is why I stopped making requests to
parents. That suggests that difficulty to drop the old theory
(which may come from difficulty of shifting attention) was
one of the primary problems.</P>

<P>Though I lacked theory of others' decision making, I had
theory of others' knowledge, but it was incomplete. I would
have passed Sally and Anne test even when I was two years old,
if only two puppets were made to be same in size. But if Sally
were taller than Anne and looked like an adult, I would not
have been able to answer correctly until thirdgrader.</P>

<P>I lived in a black and white world, and I thought "any
adult knows anything better than any kid." That is why I did
not tell lies to my parents, not because I could not deceive,
but because I thought it were useless anyway. I thought adults
know everything like god, though they cannot change anything
what they know (just as they cannot have reruns of the TV shows
they missed at their will). I believed that kids become adult
on their 20th birthdays, so everyone gets very smart and tough
overnight. I dropped this 20th birthday theory one day, when I
was 8 years old, not through observation of people but again,
by analogy. I had to give up the idea that spring starts on
March the 1<SUP>st</SUP>, summer on June the 1<SUP>st</SUP>,
and so on after I recorded temperature every day for my earth
science assignment.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

Elsa replied to this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I got quite a nasty shock when I started school
and discovered my mother and teachers had different
opinions. However, I generalised this in a slightly different
way to you; I came to the conclusion that my mother was smart
and that all teachers were stupid...  This idea stuck for
a <EM>very</EM> long time (and smart kids were definitely
smarter than stupid teachers).</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Katja reflected on the idea of a test like the
Sally-Anne-test, but with one doll looking like an adult,
and wondered about what result such a test would give:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I don't think anyone ever did such a test, but I wouldn't
be surprised if NT children would also be more likely to
give an incorrect answer (or would do so at an age where they
are already able to solve the usual Sally Anne test with two
child dolls). It's normal that children believe that adults,
or their parents, are more or less godlike. Of course, adults
have many abilities the children don't have, and some of them
must just seem like magic. And if you see that someone has some
abilities which are totally inexplicable and like magic to
you, it can easily look like xe would be able to do and know
everything. For autistic children, there are even more things
which seem totally inexplicable. If you can't read faces, and
don't even know about the importance of facial expression (and
other body expression as well), or that it has any meaning, it
looks like mind-reading if someone knows things about someone
else which were expressed by that means. And if someone seems
to be able to mind-read in some cases, why should xe not be
able to mind-read in the Sally-Anne scenario?</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>However, even if the result - a belief that adults know
everything, or almost everything - may be the same, Niki L sees
a difference between the thoughts leading to this belief:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>It was not like magical thinking that I hear NT children
form, it was quite logical and all the more difficult to throw
away because of it's logicalness. I derived the wrong theory
from the fact adults say something like "you will like it,"
"you are going to have fun," "it won't hurt," and so on. Here,
the primary problems were semantic-pragmatic problem and lack
of intuition (or too narrow focus of attention).</P>

<P>I had been trapped in pseudo-magical-thinking. The end
product happened to be similar to magical thinking NT children
form, but it was formed not because of lack of objectivity but
because of lack of information and over-adherance to logical
calculation. It seems to me that my lack of information
came from narrow focus of attention and lack of intuition,
and that my over-adherance to logic came from slow attention
shift and again, lack of intuition. For an AC child who misses
a lot of information including social cues, what seems to
be magical thinking to NT professionals or parents reflects
the reality.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Katja commented:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You may be right. I thought of magical thinking as a
result of some sort of logic, too - if someone is able to
do <EM>one</EM> thing I can't explain, that person might be
able to do other things I can't explain as well. But I am not
sure if this really is the explanation for magical thinking
in NT children. It seems to me that I always applied logic
to a much bigger extent than most people around me.</P>

<P>There is one thing which strikes me about the
Sally-Anne-test. On first view, it may seem very obvious which
answer would be "right," and in a way, not to know that Sally
would not be able to know about the marble may show a lack of
<ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM>. But in a way,
it may even show the opposite: It could show that you were
able to see that if <STRONG>you</STRONG> wouldn't be able to
know something in a given situation, it doesn't mean someone
else wouldn't, and that other people might have a perception
different from yours. To interpret what it means if a child
answers incorrectly, we have to know <EM>why</EM> it answered
that way. Also, there might be several ways how to reach the
"right" conclusion, and not all of them would show anything
like <ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM>. The other
problem with the "right" answer is that even if it's most
likely that Sally will look for the marble in the basket,
I can think of several possibilities why she wouldnt, for
example bad memory, or that she has made the experience before
that Anne took the marble out and put it into the box. So,
the best possible answer to the Sally-Anne-test would be
"Its very likely that Sally will look for the marble in the
basket, but it's not impossible that she will look in the box,
or maybe in some other place, or she may not look for the
marble at all."</P>

<P>The same goes for tests which are about reading
faces (and may be proposed as <ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of
Mind">ToM</ACRONYM>-tests, although I don't see why not being
able to read faces would necessarily show a lack of <ACRONYM
TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM>). Without knowing anything
about the individual expression of a person, I claim that
it is impossible to say with certainty which expression the
person displays, but thats exactly what you are expected to
do. To know what expression is <EM>most likely</EM> displayed
is helpful (and I would like to have this knowledge more often
than I do). But to believe that this definitely is the right
answer is misleading and dangerous.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>We will now go back from <ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of
Mind">ToM</ACRONYM>-tests to the concept of <ACRONYM
TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM> in general. Jared has
formed his own "theory of Theory of Mind":</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I have something of a theory on the "Theory of Mind"
hypothesis. My view also impacts (and grew out of a reaction
to) psychodynamic theory. I have long suspected that what is
called "projection" is not a defense mechanism, nor is it so
much a (subconsciously) active process, but is really a mild
form of egocentricity. Basically, I assumed that people lazily
and habitually assumed others thought the way they did. (Some
cases may be intentional rationalization for self-defense,
but for the most part I think it is a passive, unintentional
assumption made to understand others.)</P>

<P>More recently, I was able to clarify this view by
considering it in terms of cognitive theory, and found it
to be a model of why Autistic people often seem to lack
"Theory of Mind" to normal people (while normal people seem
to lack "Theory of Mind" to some Autistic people). I think
that "projection" is a type of social heuristic (a "rule of
thumb" used to solve a problem quickly at the expense of
accuracy). More to the point, I believe that "projection"
is basically a social form of the "availability heuristic,"
an assumption that what is readily available to the mind is
typical - in practice this means that whatever is typical of
one's own experience is considered typical in general, and can
be assumed true as default (unless known otherwise). Since
people have more experience with their own behavior, much
more knowledge of their own thoughts and feelings, and direct
knowledge <EM>only</EM> of their own thoughts and feelings,
this is what is available to them. Thus, they use this
assumption to guess motives and predict action of others. The
results may not always be right, but it works enough (with
perhaps some moderation some of the time) to be useful.</P>

<P>I believe that for people who are relatively typical -
particularly normal people in their own culture - it works
enough of the time to be very efficient, and this makes it
rewarding, thus reinforcing the use of this heuristic - thus,
this kind of thinking becomes pervasive and automatic. It
may not work (or may even backfire) occasionally, but is
mostly adaptive.</P>

<P>Since Autistic people are less likely to see
things as connected, we may be less likely to make this
assumption. Further, since our sensory experience and thinking
may be different, and we may lack many socially learned
assumptions, we may not be a good "model" for the behavior of
most people around us. As a result, this heuristic may not
give accurate or useful results for us - thus, this type of
thinking is neither adaptive nor reinforced for most Autistic
people - so even if an Autistic person does try this approach,
it is not likely to be repeated much. Those Autistic people
who are very intelligent may learn to model other people
in a more analytical way, however, as part of adapting to
society. For those who are skilled in this, it may become
very accurate, and make a few Autistic people seem to have
exceptional insight into people. However, even for them there is a
social disability, because this accuracy is at a great cost in terms of
speed and efficiency, and is maybe virtually useless in practical
situations (which involve "real- time" interaction and fast
interpretation and response). Thus, given time I may be able to analyze
someone in various ways, and seem to get good results, but may not
pick-up on certain aspects of an interaction until I am obsessing over
it hours or days later. So in practical situations, I have
impaired social cognition, with problematic results, while I
may seem to have good insights into people at other times.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Several people commented on the time aspect. Hal said:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I think I can relate to this experience.  I develop great
insights into people over time, but in the moment, well,
"I don't think well on my feet" is an expression that comes
to mind that I know applies to me.  It seems impossible to try
to focus on my own thoughts or feelings and consider different
thoughts or feelings in another person or persons at the same
time, especially if I am talking or actively listening to the
other person talk.  It takes time to process all the various
components of a social interaction.  I believe I spend huge
amounts of time doing this, a lot of the time I spend alone
goes into this.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Jean Miller experiences the same:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I also have a hard time applying what I know about people
(from doing my 'homework') in any real time situation with
them.  I sort of start from scratch with people all the time.
I really study people - after the fact - and I do spend a
lot of alone time doing that.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

Jane Meyerding went deeper into this subject. She sees a
qualitative difference in those two kinds of processing,
slow and quick:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Speed is a good analogy here, I think. People often impress
me as a speed, a frequency. As Hal says, it takes time. NT
people (some of them, anyway) are busy absorbing all the
ripples on the surface of a person and making a judgment
on that basis. Meanwhile, I see the ripples as blinding or
irritating flashes in my eyes (so I close my eyes, if I can
get away with it), but/and some other part of me, some sense,
is becoming aware of the frequency at which the core of the
person is vibrating. Some people resonate well with me. They
tend to be the slower (in frequency) bear-like people. Others
have a frequency that, as my sister would say, makes my
teeth itch. They tend to be the flashier, more impressive
(to NTs) people.</P>

<P>My slow way of apprehending people can be (or seem) quite
"penetrating" when NTs become aware of it. (I don't like that
way of describing it. Seems to me more a case of resonance
that of penetration.) They don't realize anything is happening
in/with me because I am not reacting (positively) to all
those ripples and they assume I am not sensitive to other
people. Well, I am. But I am <EM>slowly</EM> sensitive.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Jean Miller added:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Me too, Jane. And it strikes me I'm absorbing and
considering a great assortment of things about them. That's why
I say I have antisopagnosia[<A NAME="2b" HREF="#2a">2</A>]!
I know people's faces down to
the acne scars on the left corners of their chins and what
their eyes do when they speak, and how the hairs of their
eyebrows curl, and how their hairlines curve around the tops
of their foreheads.</P>

<P>I sometimes think this kind of 'thick description' would
alarm people.  Would feel intrusive to them. (Keep your
eyes of my friggin acne scars!)  And would seem obsessive.
In a way it is obsessive, hyperfocused, but I have to do it
or be hypofocused.  When someone is important to understand
and I have the opportunity to accumulate 'data,' I have a
field guide to them.Without this, I find people bewildering.
The best I can do is start picking up bits of data during
my encounter with them because there's not much else I can
do. It's pretty tiring, though, and explains something of
why social situations are so draining for me.</P>

<P>That said, I'm not sure what kind of information about them 
I'm attempting to process. Maybe it's a search for an underlying 
principle by which to understand them. It's definitely not 
an attempt to interpret others' behavior, but to interpret 
<EM>them</EM>. Why would this particular person see things 
this way?  Maybe it's yet another area in which I'm scurrying, 
busily trying to figure out <EM>underlying principles</EM> 
to make any kind of sense out of anything at all.  People, 
as information, seem way more perplexing than any other 
'reality.'</P> 
 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Elsa also describes how she studies and analyzes people
and their actions all the time, and her problems to interact
with people in real time:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I too study people, almost to the point of obsession. I
find some people's actions / motivations etc. extremely
intriguing. Some people puzzle me. Often after I've had a
conversation with someone I cannot sleep at night because
I am analyzing the conversation. I rerun the whole thing,
look at what went wrong and what didn't, work out what might
have actually been meant by that, think about more accurate
answers, etc. I also plan conversations ahead of time
if I know I am going to have to talk to someone. In fact,
conversations / social interactions all seem like a strategy
game to me. You have to plan your moves in advance, work out
all the possible ways the opponent might respond, and try and
work out different courses of action for each of these. The
only problem is, often in real time and life, the other person
makes a move you haven't accounted for, resulting in the end
of any conversation. Thus, while I spend vast amounts of time
analyzing social situations, the practical side of things is
still highly stressful and very hard to do successfully.</P>

<P>Also, people often comment on how unpredictable my
reactions are. Often I either over- or underreact because I
didn't realize the context of an event (I think this might
have something to do with what Jared was  saying about not
seeing things as connected).</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In addition, she has a problem she shares with many of us,
a difficulty to recognize faces:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>People's faces are another problem altogether. Unless
I know someone very well, I find it very hard to identify
people. I forget names too. If I want to remember people,
I have to pick a certain characteristic and memorize it. E.g.
this person has a mole on their forehead and their name rhymes
with 'street'. One trivial result of this is that I cannot
follow movies on TV. More drastically I still can't always
recognize or sometimes confuse the teachers at school, even
though I've been there for 5 years. (There are 2 teachers in
the science department who have short brown hair, glasses,
and always wear long socks. I never use their names because
I don't have a clue which one is which!). I guess this is
not a very socially acceptable way of recognizing people!</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>She then wrote about having insight into people, and that
she doesn't always think it's a very favorable thing:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I have had this happen all too often. I think it is because
I tend to remain totally objective and unmoved by many NTs'
problems. I also tend to listen more than talk, and anything
I say is rather straight forward and blunt. Because of my
objectivity and lack of personal interest, NT's often feel
unthreatened by me and tend to confide in me. Then they
assume they are closer to me than they really are... it all
gets very annoying!!!</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Katja could partly relate to this experience, although
she sees it less negative:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I have often been the objective listener in whom people
liked to confide, too. I don't mind to have this role, and
by hearing people tell about problems which were often very
foreign to me, I also learned a lot about people in general. I
believe that a lack or deficit in automatic processing of
"people information" is actually an advantage to have this
role, because it means that I don't judge or form an own
opinion quickly (often not at all). I also don't mix emotions
and logical reasoning, as many people do.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Jared reflected on different ways of thinking:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I think my view of other people was/is unusually flexible
because I lack a specific "people" way of thinking (separate
from objects), so I do not "see" myself in others.  Instead,
it is all processing abstract concepts and systems - much
like computer programs or physical forces.  However, I have
been quite aware for a long time that others had (different)
knowledge and motives.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This is a bit different for Patricia Clark, who said:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>At this point, all I can add is that perhaps I was not so
aware that others had different knowledge and motives. I was
more aware that I have <EM>no idea</EM> what their knowledge
and motives were, in most cases.  So I was living in a world
of chaos, not your world of realization that they were operated
by other knowledge and motives than I had!</P>

<P>Seems like a small distinction, but my chaotic surroundings
have affected my ability to function.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Jared answered:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I sometimes think that not all autism is really the
same thing
 -  just similar.  So maybe it's different for different
 people.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Niki L agreed to this, and added:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Moreover, I suspect that "<ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of
Mind">ToM</ACRONYM> problems" are not primary problem, just
several patterns of manifestation of secondary problem.</P>

<P>Maybe "lack of intuition" would be more basic, primary
factor than <ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM>
itself. Many ACs lack some sort of intuition and have a hard
time guessing hidden rules many NT kids somehow see, and if
the AC person has enough "reality-check" ability and enough
interest in the outside world to find something looks strange,
xe tries to fill the gap with knowledge and logic instead
of intuition. Of course the nature of knowledge or logic
depends on xyr experience, reasoning ability, environment,
object of current perseveration and fixation, and so on.</P>

<P>The combination of these factors leads to many kinds of
<ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM> problems,
including just delay of attaining one, or formation of
partial <ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM>
(like myself before age ten or so), or maybe slightly funny
<ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM>, or total lack
of any. Of course, with certain combinations, many ACs will
form perfect <ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM>,
but maybe just fail to apply it to everyday situation as
intuitively and automatically as many NT people do, because
of problem in intuition, and have to think every time.</P>

<P>I think I eventually formed a relatively good theory of
mind, but it took intentional effort. And I still have to
apply it manually. It gets faster and faster as I collect many
patterns in my memory, but I'm afraid it won't be automatic
forever.</P>

<P>I am not sure if I should have written "I'm afraid" now,
because having to apply it intentionally has it's good side,
too.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Katja replied:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Yes, I absolutely agree. Automatic and instant processing
of facial expression is something which often works really
well, and something I sometimes miss, but it can also get
into the way. NT people have often misinterpreted my facial
expression and assumed that I was unhappy when I was perfectly
happy, or that I was unconcentrated when I was concentrated,
or that I didnt have feelings at all, etc. This can be quite
annoying. It seems that this is hard to control for many NTs
because it happens automatically and often unconsciously. Its
certainly important for autistic people to learn something
about facial expression and body language. But it's also
<EM>very</EM> important for NTs, especially those who have
some connection with autistic people or other people with
unusual expression, to learn to be more conscious about their
automatic processing, and to learn that some people express
themselves differently.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>We are getting towards the end of our presentation. As
you may remember, it started with a question about Theory of
Mind asked by Elsa George. We have discussed many aspects
of this, but she is still, or even more so, wondering about
one thing:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The way I understand Theory of Mind now,  Lack of <ACRONYM
TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM> = a belief that everybody
shares your knowledge of things / everybody thinks the same
way you do / experiences everything the same way you do.</P>

<P>If this is so what makes anyone think that it's AC's who lack
theory of mind? Uta also says that AC's don't understand social
rules and appear not to have any knowledge of them. In this
case problems are caused by the fact that  NT's assumesuch
knowledge is universal (= LoToM). Personally I have little
doubt that I think differently to most others. This has caused
problems at school sometimes when teachers have automatically
assumed I'm wrong without bothering to understand what I did
(= LoToM). Of course, there are exceptional teachers who take
the time and effort and like it when someone has a different
approach, but they are few and far between. Finally, I wonder
how many of us have been 'accused' of being oversensitive. How
true! But this does not mean our experience was deluded or
wasn't really experienced this way. People can be very nasty
in their belief that it does (= LoToM).</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Jared tried to give an explanation why both ACs and NTs may
see a lack of <ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM>
in the respective other group:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Because Autistic people see most normal people as seeming
to assume everyone is like themselves, and would react as
they would in the same situation, normal people may often
seem to lack "Theory of Mind" ("<ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of
Mind">ToM</ACRONYM>-less NTs") to many high functioning
Autistic people. On the other hand, normal researchers are
tempted to assume lack of or deficiency in "Theory of Mind"
when Autistic people don't automatically jump to these
conclusions.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Elsa replied:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This makes sense! It is logical that people who think
differently will have trouble understanding other peoples
thoughts / actions / interactions. Its seems to me that
this is a matter about whether <ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of
Mind">ToM</ACRONYM> is valid in a particular situation or
not, not about whether or not someone has it. In which case
<ACRONYM TITLE="Theory of Mind">ToM</ACRONYM> works between
NT's, and it works between AC's but it fails when AC's and
NT's interact together.</P>

<P>I often do have a lot of difficulty understanding people's
actions / decisions etc. but I do not think this is because of
a LoToM. It is just that I don't personally see the worth or
value of their reasons. E.g. I know that people think I look
strange because my clothes are home made and unfashionable,
however I fail to see what, in itself, makes unfashionable
clothes look strange... except for the fact that nobody else
wears them. Which suggests that things are strange if they
don't conform to what the majority does, but again I can't
draw any connection between the two. It all seems to boil
down to different value judgements.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>With this, we want to finish this presentation. We hope
that everyone got something out of it, and that it leads to
further discussion. Thank you for listening.<P>

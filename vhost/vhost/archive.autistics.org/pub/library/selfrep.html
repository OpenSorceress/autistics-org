<h1>Echolalia and Re-Auditorization</h1>
</div>

<p>
CAPD can lead to Echolalia (the repetition of speech, often with no comprehension of meaning) or Re-Auditorization (the repetition of speech which leads to comprehension of meaning).</p>

<p>
In some cases, I have a certain amount of echolalia.  I will repeat things with no idea as to the meaning, often without meaning to.  This does not happen, however, so often that most people would even notice it.  I think my parents would have taken it as a "word-game" since I also had "adequate" speech from an early age and they were not watching for it.</p>

<p>
I also have re-auditorization.  This means that when I hear a word or phrase that I do not understand, I will repeat it (usually quietly, to myself, and often rapidly) and then it will make sense.</p>

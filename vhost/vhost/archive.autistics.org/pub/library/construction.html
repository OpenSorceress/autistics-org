<H1>The muskie Construction Site</H1>

<P>Why has the webmaster not been updating autistics.org often enough?  She has been in use as a construction site.  <A HREF="#comments">See the bottom of this page for her comments on the matter.</A>

<P><IMG SRC="images/mconst_01.jpg" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="400" ALT="part of muskie's head is visible with a triangular wooden block on top of it"></P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/mconst_02.jpg" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="400" ALT="muskie sitting at a table with wooden blocks on her head and shoulders"></P>

<P>The DSM criteria for autism list "lack of social or emotional reciprocity" as one criterion.  One example it gives is "involving others in activities only as tools or 'mechanical' aids."  In inviting another autistic person to her home, little did muskie know that she would become a construction site as a result.  She should remember to stereotype more often.</P>

<P>In addition to muskie, her kitchen table became co-opted for this purpose.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/mconst_03.jpg" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="400" ALT="a structure of wooden blocks">

<P><IMG SRC="images/mconst_04.jpg" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="400" ALT="the same structure of wooden blocks, different angle">

<P><IMG SRC="images/mconst_05.jpg" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="400" ALT="another structure of wooden blocks, under construction">

<P><IMG SRC="images/mconst_06.jpg" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="400" ALT="the same as the last structure, from a different angle">

<P><IMG SRC="images/mconst_07.jpg" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="400" ALT="the completed second structure">

<P>When the structures began to fall apart, muskie came into use not only as a construction site, but as a construction <EM>vehicle</EM>, as she rolled around picking up fallen pieces of wood.</P>

<P>For another large construction (or, rather, mining) vehicle named muskie, see the <A HREF="http://little-mountain.com/bigmuskie/">Big Muskie</A> website.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/mconst_08.jpg" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="400" ALT="the second structure partially toppled, muskie rolls around in her wheelchair picking up pieces with her reacher">

<P><IMG SRC="images/mconst_09.jpg" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="400" ALT="muskie continues to pick up pieces with her reacher">

<P><IMG SRC="images/mconst_09.jpg" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="400" ALT="muskie continues to pick up pieces with her reacher">

<P>And in the end, she doubled as a wrecking ball.  (Dyspraxia will do that.)</P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/mconst_10.jpg" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="400" ALT="muskie knocks over the rest of the structure with her reacher">

<A NAME="comments">

<P>What were muskie's comments on this page?</P>

<P><EM>"I disavow any responsibility for or knowledge of the assistant webmaster's actions in regards to the autistics.org website."</EM> (uttered as an autistic houseguest who shall remain nameless uploaded the photos to the computer and started messing around with the FTP site)

<P><EM>"I need to be more careful when I give out the root password."</EM>

<P><EM>"You're dangerous when you're bored."</EM></P>

<P><EM>"Beware, I may not have a digital camera, but I'm sure I can find some form of revenge to be had."</EM>

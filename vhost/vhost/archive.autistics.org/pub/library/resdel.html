<h1>Delayed Response to Speech</h1>
</div>

<p>
Because of <a href="delay.html">delayed speech processing</a>, I can sometimes take longer to respond to speech than I am "supposed to".  I have been told by some people that sometimes I seem to sit there and visibly take awhile to process what they are saying before I respond.  This could be partially because of CAPD, and partially because I sometimes have difficulty formulating words to respond with.</p>

<p>
This can also lead to interrputing or overload, because I may be responding in the middle of the person's next sentence or paragraph.</p>

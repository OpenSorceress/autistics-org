SIZE=+2>What is it...?</FONT></EM></H1>


<BR>

<DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><P>Autism is a
developmental disability of the brain,
much like dyslexia, mental retardation,
or attention deficit disorder. Autism
is <STRONG><EM>not</EM></STRONG> a
form of mental retardation, and though
many autistic people appear to function
as retarded, they are frequently quite
intelligent. According to the Autism Society
of America, "<I>autism...occur</I>[s]<I>
in approximately 15 of every 10,000
individuals</I>...[and]...<I>nearly 400,000
people in the U.S. today have some form of
autism.</I>"<SUP>1</SUP>

<P>The word autism may actually refer to
several similar disabilities, including
<I>Autistic Disorder, Aspergers Syndrome,</I>
and "<I>Atypical" Autism</I> (a type of
<I>Pervasive Developmental Disorder,
not otherwise specified</I>). Though
there are some differences between these
conditions, they are quite similar, and
those who have them experience many of the
same difficulties in life.</DIV> <H2> What
is autism like for those who have it?</H2>
<DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The symptoms of autism can
vary widely from one individual to the next.
Autism is referred to as a spectrum disorder
because it ranges in severity across a wide
range of conditions, like the colors of a
rainbow. In additions, some people may be
affected more by one symptom, while others
may be affected more strongly by a different
symptom. Also, some of the symptoms may have
variable manifestations.</DIV> <H3> Sensory
Processing</H3> <DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Autistic
people tend to have unusual sensory
experiences. These experiences may involve a
sense being too sensitive, less sensitive than
normal, and/or difficulty interpreting a sense
("<EM>agnosia</EM>"). These experiences do not
involve hallucinations; autistic people have
sensory experience based on real experiences,
like normal people, but the experience may feel
or sound different, or the autistic person may
have difficulty interpreting the experience. No
two autistic people appear to have the exact
same pattern of sensory problems.

<P>It is not uncommon, for example,
for an autistic person to avoid being
touched. This is usually because of a
heightened sense of touch � a gentle touch to
most people may hurt or shock some autistic
people. Others may experience confusion,
due to difficulty interpreting the sensation
or insufficient sensation reaching the brain
to interpret. Another, not uncommon pattern
is to have the strength of the sensation
inverse from that of the stimulation, so that a
gentle touch may feel like an electric shock,
but firm contact may not be a problem. Some
autistic people may be insensitive to pain,
and fail to notice injuries.

<P>Hearing may also be heightened, so that
noises that don't bother others may hurt an
autistic person's ears. Many autistic people
have trouble making out what is said to them,
as they have trouble processing sound.

<P>Vision may also be affected. Some
autistic people are <EM>prosopagnostic</EM>
("face-blind"), that is, have trouble
recognizing people. This means that learning
to recognize someone is hard, recognition
may be slow, faces tend to be analyzed rather
than recognized automatically, and many normal
effects of seeing a person may be absent. The
exact effects and severity may vary between
people. Other autistic people may have their
eyes hurt by bright light or certain flickering
or vibrating frequencies.

<P>One common effect of these heightened
senses, is that autistic people are vulnerable
to sensory overload with continued low-level
bombardment.  This may also result from too
much emotional or social stimulation. Autistic
people may become overloaded in situation that
would not bother (or might even entertain) a
normal person. When overloaded, autistic people
have trouble concentrating, may feel tired
or confused, and some may experience physical
pain. Too much overload may lead to tantrums
or emotional outburst.  Another result of
too much overload may be "<EM>shutdown</EM>,"
in which the person looses some or all of the
person's normal functioning. Shutdown may feel
different to different people, but is extremely
unpleasant.</DIV> <H3> Misunderstanding</H3>
<DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Autistic people have a
great deal of trouble understanding things
in the social environment. This includes both
understanding of social cues and conventions,
and understanding language. (The primary
difference between Autistic Disorder and
Aspergers Syndrome is that those with Aspergers
are defined to have less severe communication
problems and no speech delays.)

<P>One aspect of autism is that it is like
being in perpetual culture shock, no matter
where the autistic person goes or how long the
autistic person stays. They don't understand
many of the basic social assumptions that
others take for granted (often without
even being consciously aware of them). In
many situations, it's like being dropped
into the middle of an unfamiliar play, and
being the only one there who doesn't know
the script, you're role, or even what play
you're in! What's going on? What should
I do? Why is <STRONG><EM>X</EM></STRONG>
crying, <STRONG><EM>Y</EM></STRONG> happy,
and <STRONG><EM>Z</EM></STRONG> sneaking
around grumbling? Life � especially social
life � can be very, very confusing! Autistic
people generally don't know how to handle
innuendoes, either.

<P>Autistic people lack normal non-verbal
communication and body language, and may thus
seem more literal minded or unemotional than
they actually are.

<P>Autistic people also have trouble with
verbal communication. This usually involves
what is called a <EM>semantic-pragmatic</EM>
component. This means that an autistic
person may take a statement or question in a
very literal or unusual way; like the comic
character Amelia Bedelia<SUP>2</SUP> from
Peggy Parish's children's book series. This
could include things like interpreting
"<I>I'd like coffee with my cereal</I>" to
mean cereal with coffee in it<SUP>2</SUP>.
Another example could be innocently answering
"<I>what do you do when you get cut</I>" with
"<I>bleed</I>," instead of describing what
should be done about the cut<SUP>3</SUP>.

<P>Many autistic people have other
communication difficulties, such as
trouble remembering vocabulary, or trouble
pronouncing words. Some may have <EM>Apraxia
of Speech</EM>, meaning difficulty coordinating
speech movements.  Others have characteristics
of speech disorders called <EM>aphasias</EM>.
Some autistic people may be mute, or may
occasionally lose the ability to speak. Some
may have odd pronunciation, inflection, or
vocal qualities.  Many autistic people may
pause and need extra time to process verbal
comments or questions, and to formulate
replies. Repeating things that have been
heard (<EM>echolalia</EM>), is not uncommon,
nor is repeating ones own words.</DIV> <H3>
Attention</H3> <DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Autistic
people have trouble handling multiple stimuli.
The problem is that they have very narrowly
focused attention, and can't keep up with
more than one thing at a time. Most people
have a mind like a flashlight, with an area
of high focus, and a larger area of partial
awareness; the autistic mind is more like a
laser-pointer, that highlights only a single
small dot. Also, shifting attention is a
relatively slow process, and involves a sort
of pause or moment of delay. While Attention
Deficit Disorder is primarily a disorder
of inconsistent (often short) attention
<EM>span</EM>, autism involves other dimensions
of attention call <EM>selectivity</EM> and
<EM>shifting speed</EM>, specifically, too
narrow of a focus and difficulty and slowness
shifting foci.  (Though many autistic people
also have symptoms of ADD as well, not all do.)
One result of this is that autistic people
tend to not see things as connected.</DIV>
<H2> What are Autistic People Like?</H2> <DIV
ALIGN=JUSTIFY>There is great deal of variety
among autistic people. Some autistic people may
never learn to talk and may not be able work
or to live independently.  Others may do well
in special supportive environments, working
in sheltered setting. Still others are be
totally independent and function fairly well.
The last, or "<EM>high-functioning</EM>,"
group is often not recognized.  However,
these do exist, and people need to recognize
and understand the difficulties they face, and
their unique ways of thinking, doing things,
and experiencing the world.

<P>Most autistic people seem unusually
"reactive," and reactive to unusual things. An
autistic person who seems to take major
emergencies in stride may become upset over
any surprise happening, even a minor one (like
dropping pencil). Autistic people may often
seem unemotional, but can be very emotional
when something is important to them. Many are
much more candid and expressive with their
emotions than normal people.

<P>Autistic people tend to dislike, or at least
be uninterested in, change.  Many have strong
attachments to objects, places, or routines,
and become very upset if forced to abandon
these things. Something that seems silly to
others may be very important to an autistic
person.

<P>Most autistic people have a few very
intense interests, that may seem almost
obsessive. These could be as ordinary as
sports, as technical as neurology, or as odd
as memorizing train schedules. Autistic people
take their special interests very seriously.

<P>Autistic people are often aloof, and may
be seen as extremely shy. However, while some
may be very socially anxious, others are not
anxious about people, but either uninterested,
or are unaware of how to interact with or
approach others. Some may not notice people,
because of being absorbed by other things. Some
are very interested in getting to know others,
some may not care, and other may actively avoid
social contact. However, it is a mistake to
assume autistic people lack affection; some
can be very affectionate toward those they
know and care about. The lack of normal body
language may make them seem more distant or
unemotional than they actually are.

<P>Autistic people may do strange things, like
rocking back-and-forth, flapping their hands
in front of their eyes, humming, talking to
themselves, spinning in circles, or repeating
things. Some of this is just for fun, or out
of excitement or distress. Sometimes, strange
behaviors are to compensate with sensory
problems. The repetitiveness is related to the
natural repetitiveness and narrow focus of the
autistic mind. Talking to oneself or giggling
for no apparent reason is often the result of
intense daydreaming or remembering, but may
sometimes result from disregulated emotion,
or be a form of echolalia.  (Some � estimated
25% � also suffer from epileptic seizures
of various kinds, some of which may cause
strange behavior.) These things are harmless,
and do not result from total disorientation or
hallucinating. Some may injure themselves with
such behavior, but it should not be assumed
that such behavior is self-injurious.</DIV>
<H2> Some Things Autism is Not</H2>

<DIV ALIGN=JUSTIFY><OL> <LI> 
<P>
Autism is not
mental retardation. Some autistic people
may be very intelligent � there is a lot
of evidence that Albert Einstein may have
been autistic.</P></LI>  <LI> 
<P>
Autism is not
"savant" syndrome. Some autistic people
are "savants," (e.g., instant calculator,
etc.) but most are not. Other autistic
people are "gifted," however, and have high
"general" intelligence. Many autistic people
have normal intelligence, and some may be
retarded.</P></LI>  <LI> 
<P>
Autism is not an
emotional problem. Autism is a neurological
condition which people are usually born
with. Psychological trauma doesn't cause
it.</P></LI>  <LI> 
<P>
Autism is not a psychosis
or lack of reality contact.</P></LI>  <LI>

<P>
People do not choose to be autistic.</P></LI>
 <LI> 
<P>
Autism is not "a fate worse
than death." Autistic people have some
disadvantages, but some live very happy
and rewarding lives. Many autistic people
wouldn't want to be "cured," as this would
be like erasing them and replacing them with
different people.</P></LI> </OL></DIV>

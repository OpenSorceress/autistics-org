<h1>My Experience of AIT (Auditory Integration Training)</h1>
</div>

<p>
I went in for AIT (Auditory Integration Training), a therapy that I thought might help with my hyperacute (sometimes painful) hearing, and possibly with my CAPD symptoms.</p>

<p>
The procedure was that I would come in for a couple of sessions (I think they were each one hour, separated by a half hour, but I am not sure) a day, with a certain amount of days in a short period of time.</p>

<p>
I saw Judith Paton, an audiologist who diagnosed me (correctly) with CAPD, and (in my opinion, incorrectly) with Non-Verbal Learning Disability, and mentioned "hyperacusis" (hypersensitivity to sounds).  She administered the AIT.</p>

<p>
It consisted of weirdly modulated music, and there was a machine nearby that had filters at the different "problem wavelengths".  It was like music that would get way louder, and way quieter, seemingly at random.  I remember a particular Gordon Lightfoot song was in there, that I had to look up the lyrics to because I liked it a lot.  I also remember a song called "Everybody Must Get Stoned" and wondering whether parents would object to that one.  The audiologist said that if parents do not like some of the music they can pick it themselves.  The music is chosen for its consistency across a range of frequencies, apparently not its content.</p>

<p>
In the first few weeks, I noticed that sounds were "fuller".  Some of the high tones in things were not so intense, although I could still hear them.  A piano did not sound so "flattened" anymore.</p>

<p>
I also started noticing differences in my body awareness.  This was something nobody had warned me about.  I had been told that differences would present themselves within a certain amount of time afterward, but not this particular difference.  I now, somehow, have greater awareness of my body, but less ability to interpret the new things I am aware of.  I have had to relearn what "being sick" feels like, along with several other things.  It has been a useful but terrifying experience.  Because I am a synaesthete (I have "crossed senses") I think that some of my tactile things were affected whereas in most people they wouldn't be, because of an auditory-tactile connection that has always been there.</p>

<p>
I still have hyperacute hearing.  I am not sure whether I process sounds better or not.  The AIT seems to have mostly or maybe completely "worn off" in the auditory department, but not in the "body awareness" department.  This is odd, as AIT is not supposed to work on body awareness at all.</p>

<p>AIT is very effective for some people, ineffective for others, and in between for others.  I appear to be somewhere in the "in between" range.</p>

<P>
It shouldn't be, given that this was organized without any real input from the
autistic community itself, and in complete disregard of what we value for
ourselves.</P>


<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">You have no idea, of the heart and soul, put into this day!</FONT></EM></P>


<P>
That makes pursuing an agenda that ignores and offends autistics appropriate?</P>

PEOPLE, in the AUTISM COMMUNITY, as a whole, to UNITE............and to stand

<P>
You can't just declare unity and have it happen. You need to make it happen
first, and only then can you have it happen.  This is the first commandment of
coalition building. You broke it.</P>


<P>
What you have done wrong, and why you can't have unity:</P>

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
You disregarded the autistic community. We don't all speak with one voice. We
 aren't all high functioning aspies with Ph.D.s.  Some of us aren't even
 verbal-- but we do have voices in the electronic world. The very name
 of the rally is an insult to many of us. You  can no longer assume
 you'll be  hearing our silence. You are going to need to learn to hear
 our <EM>voices.</EM></P></LI>


<LI>
<P>
Your agenda, though you deny it to us, and softpedal it at times,
 is to get Congress to pour money into finding a cure. I remember well
 the original announcements of this rally: how they talked of cures, spoke of
 children but not adults, and invited parent involvement-- but not ours.
 Even your original website was spectacularly inaccessible to autistic
 persons:  the intense colored puzzle-piece background was too painful to
 look at.  I remember what I had to do with my monitor and
 browser settings just to be able to view your site. </P>

 
<P>
If that's not still your not-very-hidden agenda, explain what your
 telephone number, <STRONG>1-877-No-Autism</STRONG> could possibly mean. Explain why the word
 "cure" is used in your fundraising?  On your website? </P>

 
<P>
For most of us, "cure" sounds exactly like "kill the person you are, but
 animate your body with some alien force." For most of us "prevention"
 sounds exactly like "genocide". And no, you don't get to dismiss us all as a
 bunch of meddlesome aspie Ph.D.s. We are not all that. Some of the most adamant
 of the no-cure people I've known are non-verbal. The closest I come to
 the aspie myth myself is that I've "graduated" from  the campuses
 of Poughkeepsie State and Ypsilanti State... hospitals.</P>

 
<P>
If you want unity with us, you have to learn to compromise, not
 merely demand obedience. You could start to compromise by
 recognizing that "cure" is so offensive to many autistics that it
 destroys any possibility of cooperation. You would need to clearly and
 unambiguously remove "cure" and  "research" entirely from your
 agenda, leaving the issue a matter of personal opinion.  Soft-pedaling
 the cure agenda when confronted about it , without actually removing it
 from your telephone number, your fundraising, and every other place the
 agenda pokes through, and trying to hide behind warm fuzzy content-free
 euphemisms like "autism awareness" will not create unity...
 just anger, at your presumption that we would be silent.</P></LI>


<LI>
<P>
If you want unity you need to give us a reason to support you.  That
 means learning what we want (real services) and embracing a few of our
 goals-- not expecting us to raise awareness of , say, how much you want  
 more respite care in exchange for nothing. That tit-for-tat is how politics
 works.  If you're going to Washington, you ought to first learn the
 basic rules of politics.</P>



</UL>

<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">To show, their many wonders, talents, and gifts, along with
the fact that many people do live very well with the DX, of Autism. </FONT></EM></P>

 
<P>
And many people-- <EM>far</EM> more than live well-- live very badly. Many
 of us are now, or have been, homeless. I myself spent <EM>years</EM> living on the
 streets. Those of us who need assistance with daily living tasks can't get
 it. Those of us who need help with employment can't get it. I know one
 autistic adult who recently was reduced to eating coffee grounds after
 the parent who was her primary caregiver died. </P>

 
<P>
I have very little sympathy for the letters sent to me about how I just don't 
 understand that their kids might run out in traffic. I was one of
 those kids who sometimes ran into streets, not because I didn't know
 that cars could hurt me, but because I couldn't always recognize the
 difference between a parked car and a moving car.  At 42, I still cannot
 judge speeds and distances of cars very well as a pedestrian. I've  had
 strangers grab me by the collar and pull me out of traffic, more than once. 
 I even had one woman  insist upon getting my telephone number and then
 calling, frequently, to urge me to do something about this problem.</P>

 
<P>
It was nice sentiment on her part. But there is nowhere I can turn
 to for help. <EM>Nowhere.</EM></P>  

 
<P>
You are eager to  show the world a few token adults who look good on
 the outside-- while carrying the not-very-well-disguised message that
 our  insides are defective and need to be destroyed. Most of us feel that
 who we <EM>are on the inside</EM> is the good and worthy part-- worthy enough
 to deserve support to live full lives throughout our lives, not just
 when we qualify to be humilated as pitiful poster children.</P>

 
<P>
We want real, appropriate, responsive adult services. Showing off token
 autistics denies our real lives, our real needs, and our real
 desires. It's just one more way to silence us.
</P>
 
<P>
I also have absolutely no sympathy with the argument that there just
 isn't any money for adult services. Last year I set up a small international
 fund and energency network for high functioning adults. In the past year we've
 pulled a lot of people off the streets, sent taxi and food money to that
 autistic who was living on coffee grounds,  paid the examination fees
 of an aspie teen whose parents abandoned her days before her high school
 graduation, and fed a family for a while. In a few days I'm going to be filing
 articles of incorporation and giving this project a  formal structure.
 I'm an autistic SSI recipient.  Why can I do this, and nobody else can?  Is
 it my amazing superhuman powers-- or is it that the autism establishment
 prefers their autistics invisible and silent? </P></LI>
</UL>


<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">To show this great nation of ours, OUR YOUNG ADULTS, and GROW-UPS, on the 
Spectrum.............All SIDES to AUTISM............</FONT></EM></P>


<P>
I'm not a "grown-up" (spelling corrected). I'm an adult. I'm probably older than
you are. I might even be old enough to be your mother. I don't need to be
talked at with baby talk.</P>


<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">Yes, To even show, that people, can and do function very well with Autism.</FONT></EM></P>

<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">Seems you all missed the point...........</FONT></EM></P>


<P>
No, seems you missed the point.
</P>

<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">I am so sorry, to see this...........</FONT></EM></P>


<P>
It would be better you learn from it.
</P>

<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">I am going to DC............</FONT></EM></P>


<P>
I'm staying home and putting my spare resources into the new corporation. There
are too many people waiting in line for help.</P>


<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">I am sorry, that you feel that this will in anyway hurt you, by explaining to 
others. what Autism is..........ALL ACROSS THE SPECTRUM..........</FONT></EM></P>


<P>
We don't need you to explain us. We can explain ourselves quite nicely. Most of
us do have voices, you know.</P>


<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">A day of Unity...........</FONT></EM></P>


<P>
Like I said, if you want unity, you have to make unity. You haven't made
anything of the sort. You didn't even try. You just expected us to be silent.</P>


<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">Thank you so much, for your nonsupport. What a slap in the face.</FONT></EM></P>


<P>
It seems to me that you're the one who left out what autistics themselves want.
You leave us out, you build your agenda around the very things that offend us
the most, and then you say <EM>we</EM> are not supporting <EM>you?</EM></P>


<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">Just one day...........TO show, how great and strong we are, united 
together.......</FONT></EM></P>


<P>
We are not united. Again, you can't have unity without dialogue and compromise.
</P>

<P>
In fact it isn't even meaningful to say "we", because you never included us as
a community in your plans. Your plans for us were to "hear" our silence.</P>


<P>
It's not hard to find autistic input. Wander over to <A HREF="http://www.ani.ac">http://www.ani.ac</A> for
a start, and surf from there. You'll find plenty of us. We're big, we're lively,
and we're connected. Alas for the name of your march, we aren't silent.</P>



<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">One day..........A moment in time............</FONT></EM></P>


<P>
I'm not interested in being silenced by your agenda for one moment.</P> 


<P>
I "made my voice", as I called it, after being inspired by the civil rights
movement-- you can't speak out against injustice if you can't speak. You're
giving me one more good thing to use it for.</P>

 
<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">I think you all missed the point.........I am so sorry, that you missed 
 mine........</FONT></EM></P>


<P>
Oh, I got it. I'm hyperlexic. I can read that telephone number. </P>



<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">To bring "Awareness to AUTISM".</FONT></EM></P>


<P>
Awareness for what purpose? A rally in Washington? Hmm... it just so happens
that my "area of special interest" is politics. I seem to remember that,
generally, groups that want to bring public awareness to an issue spend their
money on public service announcements and similar campaigns. Groups that want to
bring their agenda to Congress (money for a cure) generally rally in Washington.
It's a simple matter of cost-effectiveness.</P>


<P>
And awareness of <EM>what</EM> about autism? Of our "silence"? Of how pitiful we look on
your posters? Of every imaginable heartstring-pulling stereotype you could pull
out of a hat for fundraising purposes? Or maybe that those of us who are
adults all have three Ph.Ds and a Nobel Prize and no longer need help? I would
prefer the world be aware of something <EM>bona fide</EM> about autism. I, after all,
have to live with the prejudices you're trying to build.</P>


<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">Nothing More...........Nothing Less...........Period.</FONT></EM></P>


<P>
The word that comes to mind here is "liar". I can read.</P>


<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">Any Questions ?????????</FONT></EM></P>


<P>
<EM><FONT COLOR="#42426F">Carol J. Fruscella</FONT></EM></P>


<P>
You never had unity. You left us, our needs, and our priorities out, as usual.
You've chosen to insult and humilate us with everything from the name of the
rally to the poster children to the appeals to pity. You are blatantly lying
when you say that you're only about "autism awareness". How on <EM>earth</EM> can you
say that you are shocked by this?</P>

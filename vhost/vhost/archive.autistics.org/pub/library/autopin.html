<h1>The Validity of Autistic Opinions</h1> 
 
<p><i>"Given the very nature of autism, the perceptions of those who
suffer from it are likely to be skewed - and skewed in ways which
outsiders are not yet able to understand or predict.  In short, messages
from the autistic mind are transmitted on suspect equipment." --David
Newnham, <a href="http://www.mugsy.org/nowhere.htm">News from
Nowhere</a></i><sup><small><small>1</small></small></sup></p>
 
<p> I recently read part of a book which was written by an "expert" on
autism.  The author mentioned the autobiographical accounts and essays by
autistic people, saying that they might not be a good source of
information about what concerns professionals about autism.  For example,
the author mentioned, due to a lack of interest in social situations, the
autistic people might not give a clear picture of their social skills
deficits.  This would provoke a biased look at autism, according to the
author.</p>
 
<p> There are several problems with these statements.</p>
 
<p> The first is the assumption that the people who research autism, the
so-called "autism experts", are the ones with the most valid opinions on
autism.  The reality is that, just as autistics must often guess as to the
motivations of neurotypicals ("normal people" or non-autistics),
neurotypical researchers and doctors are guessing as to the motivations of
autistic people.  They see our problems as a result of the "triad of
impairments" or "allergic reactions" or "sensory integration difficulties"
or whatever their latest theory is, and forget about what is right in
front of them -- the autistic person.</p>
 
<p>There is a common assumption, that autism is just a disorder composed
of difficulties in various areas, rather than a different kind of
configuration that results in far more than just the parts doctors pick up
on.  There is a tendency, also, to see autistic individuals as needing
outside interpretation to tell us what is really going on with us.  In
reality, autistic people have the same range of judgment about ourselves
as neurotypicals, perhaps with a greater tendency toward accuracy because
of a greater tendency to be uninfluenced by societal expectations of how
we should think.  While there is a tendency for some autistics to repeat
the latest theory they have heard from their doctor, there is also a
tendency toward extremely good insight that could not come from a doctor
or other so-called "expert".</p>
 
<p>It is important to realise that autism is not solely a collection of
impairments.  Certainly, autistic people can be impaired in many areas,
but so can neurotypicals.  Neurotypicals are rarely made to see themselves
as having social impairment for being easily deceived by social situations
and social desires (as many tend to be), yet autistics are made to see
ourselves as impaired for "lacking social skills" or "lacking social
desires" (both of which may indeed be false statements in many of the
cases in which they are applied).  Neurotypicals are rarely made to see
themselves as having cognitive or communication impairment for having
difficulty thinking outside of language or symbol (as many tend to be),
yet autistics with other modes of thinking are made to see ourselves as
impaired for "lacking language skills" or "lacking symbolic thought".  
Neurotypicals are rarely made to see themselves as having impaired
imagination for often putting social games above mechanical games as
children, yet autistics are made to see ourselves as impaired in
imagination for preferring mechanical things to social things.  Even the
things that bother us the most about being autistic are some of the
least-researched, while a lot of time and effort is spent researching
things that are more an effect of the difference between autistic people
and neurotypicals (when they aren't just neurotypical fantasies about what
autism is) than something that results from being autistic alone.</p>
 
<p>What is really going on is something like a difficulty in translation
between two or more species (there are many varieties of autism just as
there are many varieties of neurotypicality) who happen to share a common
physical species.  It is a group of dogs convinced that a cat lashing his
tail in anger is really "wagging" his tail playfully.  This kind of
communicative misunderstanding should not be simply blamed on the autistic
person, or on the "impairments that come with autism."  As I have seen in
more than one circumstance, a neurotypical placed in the midst of
autistics can and will look out of place, different, "impaired", and
confused.  What exists is a gap in comprehension, and that gap <em>runs
both ways</em></p>
 
<p>Where the real "bias" comes in is where you get an outside view, by a
neurotypical with neurotypical values and morals, who seeks to impose
those values and morals on an autistic or (as in most cases) on all
autistics.  The values and morals might match up now and then (both
neurotypicals and autistics have basic human rights, for example) and
might be drastically different (an autistic might think of truth and
honesty as overriding social rules, while a neurotypical might see the
autistic as "tactless" or "rude" or even "malicious".)  The relative
importance of many things, to neurotypicals and autistics, can be
extremely different.  Saying that the neurotypical view is better, and
that the autistic way is worse, is an enormous bias.</p>
 
<p>If you read an autobiography of a neurotypical, you will generally not
read about their "strange preference of social activities to mechanical
activities as a child" or their "difficulty in thinking outside of
language and symbol" (not that these are universal characteristics of the
neurotypical, but nor are their opposites truly universal characteristics
of the autistic).  You will read about the things that were important to
them in their life, written usually in a style that suits this.</p>
 
<p> Autistics, however, are apparently expected to make a display case out
of ourselves.  If our writings do not contain several direct references to
our "impairments" (which even if they do exist, may not be what we want to
write about), either our judgment or our autism itself is brought into
question.  After all, why on earth would an autistic write an
autobiography if it weren't to make a display case out of herself and her
supposed faults and impairments?  Why would an autistic possibly want to
write something that showed who she was, not what her symptoms were?  
Why, above all, would an autistic want to write something that <em>did
not</em> totally fit the expert opinions of the time period (can you
imagine if we all had to write about our supposedly unfeeling
"refrigerator mothers", a la Kanner/Bettelheim?) but instead fit her own
experience of life?</p>
 
<p> (By the way, irony, metaphor, and humor are said to be beyond the
reach of autistics.)</p>
 
<p> Autistics are not expected to write autobiographies.  We are expected
to write textbooks, which happen to be about ourselves.  We are expected
to be museum exhibits, and well-behaved museum exhibits at that.  As soon
as we stop behaving as we should, we are either explained away in terms of
the latest theory, or taken off the shelves. (Oops, did I use another
metaphor?  I shouldn't do that.  I guess I don't get my poker chips and
M&amp;Ms for the day.)  We often feel obligated to write long descriptions
of how things are for us, partly because of the "museum exhibit"
expectations and partly because of the huge misconceptions that exist
out there about autism.</p>
 
<p>If you're going to read us, read us.  If you're going to study us,
study us.  But keep in mind you're dealing, from the "lowest" to the
"highest" functioning, with sentient beings, with an extraordinary (if
only because we are reputed not to have it) capability for knowing what is
comfortable and what is uncomfortable, and what is important and what is
unimportant, in our lives.</p>
 
<p> Professionals who do not think that autistic people write things that
concern them, should take a long and hard look at themselves and their
assumptions about autism.  They should especially look at why they
themselves should be so concerned with these things, things that
apparently (even according to them) do not concern the autistic writers
whom they are reading, with blinders on, in search of "insight".</p>

<p><sup><small><small>1</small></small></sup>Since people have asked a
lot, the two articles that sparked this one are Francesca Happe's article
criticizing autistic autobiographies in Uta Frith's book <cite>Autism and
Asperger Syndrome</cite>; and the article <a
href="http://www.mugsy.org/nowhere.htm">News From Nowhere</a>, which in
addition to insulting autistic people, commits the usual trick of
referring to all autistic people who can speak, regardless of actual
diagnosis or of communicativeness of speech, as having Asperger's
syndrome.  Doing this is a standard way to make certain people seem "less
autistic" and their opinions "less valid" when it comes to autism.</p>

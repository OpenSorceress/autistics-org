<h1>Another Parent's Take on ABA and its "Defense"</h1>

</p>

<p>My opinion exactly.</p>

<p>I am the father of an autistic son.</p>

<p>I'm also Aspie myself.</p>

<p>Ten years ago, my son attended the preschool program of the May 
Center in Arlington, MA, which uses ABA teaching methodologies.</p>

<p>These teaching methodologies work beautifully for some autistic kids, 
to teach them to learn how to learn.  They do so <em>precisely</em> because 
they leverage the children's specifically <em>autistic</em> strengths: good 
memory, attention to detail, attention to patterns and to the 
continuation and breakage of patterns.  They also break cognitive 
steps down into units that can be tuned to match the children's 
cognitive and sensory bandwidth and attention span -- both at the 
outset and as they increase over time.</p>

<p>In Jeremy's case, this made a world of difference: it made it possible 
for him to enter public school in kindergarten, in aide-assisted 
inclusion.</p>

<p>But I think the goal towards which so much autism-parent-driven ABA 
is geared -- that of rendering the child "indistinguishable from 
typical peers" -- is a dubious one at best.  The goal of Jeremy's ABA 
curriculum at the May Center was -- by our choosing -- to help him 
learn how to learn, <em>not</em> "indistinguishability" from typical peers.</p>

<p>I predict there will be a lot of business for psychotherapists in 
another ten to twenty years, as kids trained to 
be "indistinguishable" encounter one or another set of stressors in 
their lives that kick the legs out from under the behavioral 
structure they are trained into, to adopt a set of behaviors and 
perspectives that not only run contrary to the instincts and 
sensibilities they were born with, but which are presented to them in 
a manner which thoroughly devalues those instincts and 
sensibilities as inferior, worthless, meaningless.  When it becomes 
too hard or stressful to maintain the facade 
of "indistinguishability", the implosion of their self-esteem may be 
catastrophic.</p>

<p>This needn't be.</p>

<p>I am not advocating doing nothing.  That is an egregiously dishonest 
false dichotomy into which the parents and professionals who 
subscribe to the whole nine yards of "indistinguishability" as the 
goal of ABA teaching for autistic kids try to force anyone who 
disagrees with their dogma.  Let me put the lie to that false 
dichotomy right here and now.  If anything is "festering" (yo Lenny 
Schafer...) it is the dishonesty with which ABA is all too often 
oversold and misapplied.  To its own detriment, I am convinced.</p>

<p>I think it is very necessary to teach our autistic kids all about NT 
social norms and how to engage in them sufficiently to effectively 
and harmoniously accomplish their personal goals in an overwhelmingly 
NT world.</p>

<p>But that is very different from teaching them that their own autistic 
instincts are bad, or inferior, or meaningless.</p>

<p>Two analogies:</p>

<p>When I visit the home office of my employer, I adhere to its dress 
code: I wear a suit and tie.  I need to do so in order to work 
effectively within the established norms.  But I do *not* wear a suit 
and tie when I am in my own office (which has a "business casual" 
dress code), and I don't even wear "business casual" when I am not at 
work -- much more comfortable in my well-worn jeans.  Different rules 
for different contexts.  No single set of rules is "better" than any 
other; each is appropriate for its own context.  We should be 
teaching our autistic kids behavior that way; instead of over-
application of a single set of rules, they just might learn how to 
navigate a more complex set of differing contexts by learning how to 
<em>detect</em> those contexts and then apply the rule-set that is valid for 
each.</p>

<p>This analogy is beautiful in another respect: I decide how much time 
I want to spend in a suit and tie, in business casual clothes, and in 
jeans based on <em>my</em> goals for operating in the contexts associated 
with each.  If our kids crave down-time in which they can be flappy 
and stimmy, don't waste your energy and theirs attempting to totally 
extinguish that craving.  Instead, teach them in <em>which</em> contexts 
that behavior will undermine their personal goals, and in which 
contexts that behavior is safe and harmless to their interests.  And 
allow them <em>some</em> time and space in which the latter is the case, so 
they can recharge.  I can tolerate several hours in a suit and tie if 
I know I can kick into my jeans when I get home.</p>

<p>The other analogy has to do with what we teach our kids about their 
innate autistic tendencies.  I think we should teach behavior the way 
American business people are taught the language and social and 
cultural skills necessary to effectively do business in Japan.  We 
don't train American business people to become indistinguishable from 
their Japanese hosts; that would be folly.  We don't attempt 
to "cure" them of their Americanism.  We don't reinforce implicit 
messages that their American ways are inferior or meaningless.  We 
*do* teach them all about what the cultural and social expectations 
of their Japanese hosts will be, and how to effectively engage with 
those expectations in order to accomplish their business goals.</p>

<p><em>That</em> is how we should be teaching NT behavior to our autistic kids.</p>

<p>It will prevent a lot of implosions of self-esteem and crashing and 
burning in late adolescence and young adulthood years down the pike.</p>

<p>I know because I have <em>been there and done that</em>.  As my self-
awareness began to kick in in late adolescence I started to try as 
hard as I could to be as "normal" as I could.  I could never get to 
100%.  I always felt inadequate or lacking depth or resilience in 
comparison with the "normal" people around me.  I became depressed, 
as so many Aspie young adults do.  After gingerly skating around the 
edges of a nervous breakdown midway through college, I spent 
seventeen years in talking therapy of one kind or another for 
depression and dysthymia... until Jeremy was diagnosed, and we 
started reading about AS and realized that the profiles we were 
reading of AS described *my* developmental history.  When I started 
to encounter other Aspies and auties, and realized how much I shared 
with them in terms of cognitive style, aesthetic sensibilities, 
sensory needs, and social preferences, I started to give myself 
permission not to try so damn hard to be "normal".  And *that*, more 
than anything in seventeen years of therapy, helped heal my wounded 
self-esteem.</p>

<p>I don't want any kids on the spectrum to have to go through such an 
implosion and reconstruction of self-esteem.</p>

<p>And I think that the <em>way</em> we teach NT behavior, and the way we 
characterize autistic behavior as we teach, is a critical factor in 
that, and needs to be examined and rethought.</p>

<p>I think the drive towards "indistinguishability" as a goal bespeaks 
an inner conviction that society cannot be made to accommodate even 
harmless eccentricities in individual behavior, preferences, and 
social style.  I think we need to challenge that assumption.  I think 
that at a certain point, we need to decide that we have pushed for 
enough change in the individual, and that now we need to push for 
change in the individual's surrounding <em>social environment</em>, to 
accommodate the individual.</p>

<p>I think that autism is not just a disability issue.  When the really 
significant disabling factors are overcome, the remaining 
eccentricities become a <em>diversity</em> issue.</p>

<p>If our workplaces and other social institutions have managed to come 
to terms with other forms of diversity -- racial, religious, ethnic, 
gender, physical-disability -- then surely they have the resiliency 
to come to terms with <em>neurological</em> diversity.  Surely we can 
demand -- and succeed in obtaining -- accommodation for the harmless 
eccentricities and divergence in cognitive style, aesthetic 
sensibilities, sensory needs, and emotional repertoire that are part 
and parcel of our kids' identity as people on the autism spectrum.</p>

<p>And for that reason I think that we need to consider how to add 
another component to successful, state-of-the-art 
teaching/intervention for autistic kids: how to become effective self-
advocates.  How to live life proud to be autistic, and at the same 
time skilled in navigating an overwhelmingly NT world.</p>

<p>And <em>that</em> is what I think ABA-based teaching should be.</p>

<p><a href="pschwarz.html">As I wrote almost ten years ago</a>: I truly do not 
understand why more people are not capable of laying down their 
ideological battle-axes and joining me in the middle ground.</p>

<p>I still don't understand it.</p>

<p>And I welcome all who read this who find that they are ready to do so.
I'd like to work with those of you motivated to create ABA curricula 
that operate as I have described above, that teach our kids to 
navigate, not self-negate.</p>

<h1>Delayed Processing of Speech</h1>
</div>

<p>
Often it takes me a long time to figure out what someone has said.  I tend to "store" such things and process them later.</p>

<p>
In the most extreme cases, someone has said something, and I do not process it for years.  Then, suddenly, years later, I figure out what they said.  Here is an example.</p>

<p>
When I was a small child, something happened in the car.  I asked what had happened.  The reply was "dheyrzamaussinnit" said with a specific intonation.  I repeated it with the same intonation, trying to understand it.  Then I asked again.  They said it again.  I repeated it again.  "dheyrzamaussinnit".  It was kind of fun to say and had a neat sound to it, but I did not have any idea what it meant.  When I asked if I could see (something I sometimes ask if I do not understand the verbal explanation), they told me that no, I couldn't.</p>

<p>
When I was an adolescent, I finally figured it out.  "Dheyrzamaussinnit" meant "There's a mouse in it".  Of course they didn't want me to see -- there was a dead mouse in the car and that would have been yucky.</p>

<p>
In less extreme cases, it takes seconds or minutes to process something.  Sometimes it takes days, weeks, or months.  In that case, it took years.</p>

<p>
I store words and phrases that make no sense to me, and I store them exactly "as heard".  This makes it so that, whenever my language processing and whatever else it takes finally kicks in, I have a greater chance of understanding something.  I also tend to memorise things related to the event, such as the exact position I was in in the living room at the time of the "dheyrzamaussinnit" episode.</p>

<p>
In the "short delay" cases, sometimes by the time I have asked "What?" and am getting halfway through the explanation, I have already figured out what was said.  Delays of various lengths happen to me on a daily basis.</p>

<p>
One thing that is very frustrating with this kind of delay, is that sometimes I need more time than I am given to process speech.  If I do not have the time to process what is being said to me, I can wind up overloaded quickly because the other person, without knowing that I am having difficulty processing their speech, is already on to the next sentence (or paragraph) while I am still attempting to understand the first one.  I may be able to repeat the speech back as it was said, but I will not fully comprehend the meaning until later.</p>

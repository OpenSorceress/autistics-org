<h2>"People Logic" and "Common Sense"</h2>

<p>
One of the most common responses I got when my lack of understanding things, because of CAPD, showed, was "Well logically you must have known that I didn't mean that."</p>

<p>
The problem is, with the combination of CAPD and autism, I have difficulty figuring out what people are "supposed" to mean in the first place.  When the teacher (as I have related in my section on <a href="respond.html">Responding Incorrectly to Spoken Directions</a> page) heard that I had heard her talk about "incomplete sentences" when she said to write something "in complete sentences", her response was that I must be joking.  "Why on Earth would a teacher say something like 'write incomplete sentences'?" she asked.</p>

<p>
My answer was, "I don't know."  I don't know why people do things the way they do.  I have always had difficulty with that, because I am autistic.  I often get the reaction, "Use your common sense to figure out what I mean."  I don't always have their "common sense".  Sometimes when I guess, I guess wrong.  As far as that teacher goes, I had no idea why she would ask for incomplete sentences, but I was perfectly willing to give her a paper full of sentence fragments if that was what her instruction was.</p>

<p>
"Why would I tell you to do something dangerous?" is another question that seems familiar in this context.  I do not know why someone would tell me to do something dangerous, but "Why?" is a question that is dangerous for me to assume anything about, with the human mind.  My motivations and understanding of the world are often very different from other people's, so they might have a perfectly good reason to tell me to do something dangerous.</p>

<p>
Autism makes "common sense" and "people logic" difficult things to apply when mishearing words and instructions.  I could more often interpolate "what word is supposed to be there", but if words were running together or I interpreted the word wrong, I often took it as exactly how I heard it.  This has gotten me into some odd situations, and still does.</p>

<h2>Confusing the Causes</h2>

<p>
From the outside, because I am autistic, it may be more difficult than usual to attribute something to "CAPD".  For example, I also have expressive language problems, which means that two things may look about the same.  A delay in my response time may have to do with CAPD, or it may have to do with the time it would take for me to formulate a response at some times, or it may have to do with both.  This may in turn lead to someone repeating what they had said, when I heard it very well the first time.</p>

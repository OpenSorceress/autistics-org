Dear (Senator or Representative) Last Name Here:

I am a constituent, and an adult with autism. I am writing to you 
today to let you know that the "Hear Their Silence" rally for an 
autism cure does not speak for me.

Autism is a complex condition with many positive as well as negative 
aspects. We are not, contrary to popular ignorance, all "silent". 
Most of us who have speech delays learn to communicate, and many of 
us have never had a speech delay in the first place. Autism does not  
cause an autistic to suffer, or shorten our lives. Most autistic 
persons, including myself, are happy to be autistic. It gives us a 
special perspective on the world. The world would be a much worse 
place had there not been an Albert Einstein, an Erik Satie, an Andy 
Warhol, (insert your favorite AC from the past here if you would like), 
and other  scientists, inventors, composers, and artists who are 
recognized today as having been autistic.

I don't want a cure, or funding for research into a cure. What I want 
funded is appropriate education and practical support services that 
would allow me and persons like me to use our unique skills productively 
and to live happy and fulfilling lives. (insert details about what 
you want in your life here, if you'd like-- but keep the letter short!).

Sincerely

Your Name Here

<h1>Asking for Repetition ("Huh?" "What?")</h1>
</div>

<p>
Because of my CAPD symptoms, I have often asked "Huh?" or "What?" a lot.  I get responses varying from "You heard me!" to repetition of the phrase, word, or sentence in question.  Often, I cannot understand it even after several repetitions, and get frustrated.</p>

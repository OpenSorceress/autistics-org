<P>
(Pardon me for just sticking some e-mail on the web, but I want responses from as many people as possible as fast as possible, and so I'm not going to bother with writing something specifically for the website right now. Plus I'm having a painful repetitive strain injury flare-up from dealing with the e-mail and long conspiratorial IRC channel chats I've been dealing with. <STRONG>This is a dialogue that should not be held with me-- they should be holding it with the autistic community</STRONG>. I'm just a webmaster. Moreover it should have been the first thing they did, way back when they were organizing this.)

<P>
I have just gotten this e-mail.</P> 


<P>
Suggestions, anyone? As far as I'm concerned, the *key* issue for me is the
recognition that autistics are central, not marginal, to the issue of autism,
and that parents/professionals *must not* act without us as *full partners* (if
not more... after all I have more right to my own life than my parents do).
Changing words is not the same as changing the balance of power.</P>


<P>
But forcing them to change words *is* a change in the balance of power here--
not enough, mind you, but assuming they can change enough not to be impossibly
unbearable, it would be worth it to grab the victory and run... and of course
plot on to challenge the autism establishment and win lots more in the future :)</P>


<P>
So: input, please-- and feel free to forward this on to any other autistic,
ally, or mailing list. where there is interested.</P>


<P>
I need replies to this ASAP!!!</P>

Subject: How do you want us to Hear~Your~Voice<BR>
Date: Wed, 29 Mar 2000 07:01:46 -0600<BR>
From: Todd Guppy TGuppy@lgc.com<BR>
</P>


<P>
I don't know why I am asking - I'm sure my intentions will be misinterpreted
again, but how exactly would you want us to make you feel included?  What
could we say at the rally that would make you feel included?</P>


<P>
I have added a line to my little thing I am doing at the rally - because
yes, it needs to be there.  Adults with autism are making a difference in
society and I did overlook that.  I do speak of children, because I have a
child.  But I know he will be an adult someday.</P>


<P>
We will change the number, consider it 1-877-on-autism, or simply
1-877-662-8847</P>




<P>
"This is for the adults with autism - those giving us glimpses into their
lives, (meaning TempleGrandin..) sharing their experiences with us (those on
the lists who have) - allowing us to "Hear their voices."</P> 



<P>
How many times must we try to explain and make you understand - we did not
mean to make you feel excluded.  Actions speak louder than words, the number
will be changed, what would you like to be said on your behalf at the rally
- How do you want the Nation to "Hear~Your~Voice"  ??    </P>

If you don't tell her what is needed, then she can honesty say she tried and
that she asked.  Tell her everything you want.  Then if she doesn't comply,
it puts her in the wrong again.  But don't stop at alittle.  Don't make it
easy.  Tell her that you want no mention of a cure at this rally.  Tell her
you want equal power.  It the autistics voice that really counts here!  Tell
her that the rally needs to be about funding for services, not a cure.  Make
her change the whole damn thing if needed!<BR><EM>-an ally and mother</EM></P>


<P>
<EM>A comment injected here... it's not reasonable to "legislate" what each speaker will or will not say (people do have a right to their opinions, and a right to express them). Therefore "no mention of a cure" doesn't seem to be a reasonable demand to me. That the <STRONG>organization</STRONG> divest itself of all the calls for a cure in order to make room for our views is reasonable. Where things get tricky is <STRONG>who</STRONG> is speaking-- the speaker list is <STRONG>highly</STRONG> unrepresentative. And of course the power issue, and the issue of adult services remains (judging from the hate mail I've gotten from angry parents, most of them seem to expect their kids to either end up in institutions or end up "cured" or fully "recovered" (hmmm... what's that name of that river in Egypt... :-))-- the rank-and-file of ARK, anyway, don't see adult services as serious issues... which, circling back, is <STRONG>exactly</STRONG> why the power issue is <STRONG>central</STRONG>) -- Laura Tisoncik</EM></P>

who cares how reasonable it is :) if they reject it, put the email up on autistics.org and let the search engines get it<BR><EM>-an autistic</EM></P>

Why "say on behalf"? Why not invite autistic speakers to speak for
themselves? And with good intentions -- also help them get there!
(and even if not, today's technology provides other means to hear people's
voices).<BR><EM>-an autistic</EM></P>

<P> i want them to stop trying to 'cure' us...maybe we dont wanna be cured! maybe some of us enjoy being autistic (tho i wouldnt mind if i never overloaded again :) )
Proud to be an autie--parents, don't speak for me, I have my own voice! Don't try to cure me! I am who I am, and proud of it. ï¿½ chacun son gout!<BR><EM>-an autistic</EM></P>

Well I see they did change their number... Took a
look.  Hmmm I agree with the others comments on this
I've read so far.  Don't simply settle; hell most of
us have settled most our lives.  Tell them to start
with *respect* and to dump assumptions... None of us
is stereotypically anything... That for some stupid
reason most places figure you turn 18 and thats it
punt... But things aren't quite that simple.  Early
interventions are important to help with coping skills
etc(I say that as a parent... however they need a
rights of the child act like we have...  Because their
idea of therapy sometimes just breaks my heart that
that crud still happens ya know...)... However as an
adult we need to quit falling between the cracks with
unfair criterion for services.  Such as where I am
requires IQ to be less than 70 for a majority of
services that would be applicable for adults.  Some
lesser services are there but only if you are
considered to have a severe physical or mental
imparment that is in docs opinion truely
incapacitating(of which this group may do less well
than those with a assumed/assessed under 70 IQ yet
they get less services).  Tell then in short equal
rights for all... equal accessability.  Support to
peoples right to be independant and follow their
dreams.  Everyone has the right to fullfill thier
potential or follow their dreams... Without proper
supports or services that is near impossible or very
difficult in the least. <BR><EM>-an autistic</EM></P>

if you want my opinion to forward -- we need diagnoses for adults, and we need help with complicated stuff like paying bills<BR><EM>-an autistic</EM></P>

<P>
about words etc, they're still big on looking into 'causes' and 'interventions' and both of those worry me (ark) 'intervention' sounds kind of like 'stopping something in its tracks and trying to make it something different'<BR><EM>-an autistic</EM></P>


<P>
(response to the above) When the principal told me the new aid was getting "intervention" training and "behavior modification" training I asked what they meant- they were learning the "proper" way to restrain. Now they have designed a "pilot" program. It's a cement block room with no window (a safety issue) 3 kids, 2 adults (who don't have to be teachers because it's a pilot program). They are mad because they hired the main person & I refused to send my son back<BR><EM>-an ally and mother</EM></P>

<P>
While you feel that your rally was misinterpreted, I feel you have
misinterpreted the online rally. Most autistic adults probably feel the
exact opposite than a lot of parents of autistic children. The concept of a
cure is an extremely sensitive issue for both sides.</P>


<P>
I and most autistic adults that I have met would not prefer a cure. We feel
that a cure would take away a lot of gifts associated with autism (common
positive autistic traits are visual thinking or increased intelligence).
There are some disableing features of autism (such as lack of motivation,
lack of social skills, or social understanding) in addition to positive
traits. However, diversity is necessary for the survival of the speceis, and
autism is an important aspect of the diversity of the speceis. Albert
Einstein was definately autistic. Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla are very
likely autistic as well, and there is a lot of speculation about Bill Gates
having Asperger's. In fact, I have heard almost all of the most famous
scientists and philosophers have been suggested to have autism more than one
time.</P>


<P>
There is also the issue of all autistics being different and just because
one autistic person wants to be cured, doesn't mean that a cure isn't right
for some. Some autistic people may do better if they were cured. However, I
feel that the decision of whether or not to "cure" an autistic individual
should be up to the person being cured. If a cure were available, the
majority of autistic people who would receive the cure would probably be
those whos decision is made by people other than themselves.</P>


<P>
It is also said that 75% of autistics are low functioning and mentally
retarded. This is not true. The majority of autistics are high functioning.
It is only reported to be 75% because those who are lower functioning are
more likely to be diagnosed. Autistics (high and low functioning) can score
on IQ tests lower than their IQ actually is, and those who are low
functioning could have very high intelligence and nobody would know it.</P>


<P>
It is really hard to be an autistic child and have two parents controlling
you. I have been an autistic child up until a week ago when I turned 18.
Since I was diagnosed (I was diagnosed at age 10; I was lucky that they
messed up when they tried to diagnose me at age 5) my parents and teachers
had tried to force me to socialize with people when I really didn't want to.
Socializing only made me miserable, anxious, and nervous. If I knew I had an
assignment to socialize I would think about it and worry about days before,
and would feel as if I was facing the end of the world. My parents even
tried to use the state's money to buy friends (pay people $5/hour) to do
things with me. <BR><EM>-an autistic</EM></P>


<HR>

<P>
these people at this rally need to
realize that autistic children *do* grow up into autistic adults, and
services/funding needs to be provided for accordingly...maybe, there
could be something that helps us go to college? i.e. some sort of program
that pays part or all of tuition/lab/library/textbook fees so ppl who do
want to continue their education beyond highschool can, without having to
struggle with stress from various financial problems. Yes, there is
financial aid, but sometimes this isnt enough. Also, (for the ones who
dont want to continue education, or just need help with this) there ought
to be some sort of job help-- i.e. finding out our interests/goals and
helping us find a good-paying job that incorporates these things so we'll
be happy with the job and also make enough money to live
comfortably...well, this is all i can think of for the moment...<BR><EM>-an autistic</EM></P>

<P>
Well maybe it's just me and I have no idea if he has any connection
other than being an opportunistic, vindictive, DUMB Republican, but if
it were me, I'd suggest they drop Dan Burton as a speaker for one
thing.  He raises my hackles.<BR><EM>-unknown dx</EM></P>

OK, this is gonna be a lot shorter than it ought to be, but I need to say*something* about this.  I was first contacted by someone from this rally
some months ago.  I do not know if the person who contacted me is the same
person Muskie has been corresponding with.  I would have to spend some
time searching through my saved mail files to find it, so this right now
will just be a quick rundown based on memory.  The person wrote to me
asking if I would speak at the rally.  I looked at the web page that was
up then, and wrote back expressing some grave reservations.  I expressed
that the sender's email address ("ENDAUTISM") raised my serious concern
that she was holding and promoting an idea of autism that differed
radically from anything I'd be interested in supporting.  I further
pointed out that the photo collection project on their web site, in which
they were asking people to send photos of autistic people, compared the
desired collection of photos to the Vietnam Memorial.  I said that
autistic people are not "victims" and that comparing us with war
casualties would not be appreciated.  In the brief correspondence that
ensued, I did raise the question (and remember, this was *months* ago,
when they would have had ample time to act on the suggestion if they had
chosen to) of whether the rally's goals and message might be reconsidered
to be more in line with the goals of autistic advocacy.  The responses I
received indicated that my correspondent was not really grasping what I
was saying, and was more interested in persuading me that the existing
approach was really all right than in considering any possibility of
change.  At some point, being too busy and overwhelmed with potentially
productive activities to continue with [figurative] head-banging against a
[figurative] brick wall, I allowed the correspondence to lapse.</P>


<P>
The other day I looked at Muskie's site, and at her correspondence with a
rally organizer.  Again, I have no idea whether the person Muskie was
writing to is the same person I corresponded with.  Whether it's the same
person or not, clearly the concerns and issues I raised all those months
ago never received any serious discussion or consideration, and still are
not receiving serious discussion and consideration now when Muskie is
raising them again.</P>


<P>
These people are trying to sidestep the issue by claiming that their only
goal is to "raise awareness" about autism.  But it seems to me that any
time you deliberately set out to raise awareness of something, there's
inevitably *some* slant to the awareness you're trying to raise.  What is
the content of the "awareness" this rally is trying to raise?  The simple
*number* of autistic people in the country?  Or the need for "someone" to
"do something" for/about/on behalf of this number of people?  What do
they want people to learn about autism from their rally--how do they
describe the defining characteristics of autism?  What do they want people
to do in response to the awareness they hope to raise?</P>


<P>
I could go on and on, but I don't have time, and I think I've made my
point.  The issue now is, what, if anything, should we as a community do
about the "awareness" these rally organizers are raising?  I applaud
Muskie's work.  I want to help in Muskie's work.  I'm just not sure an
online counter-rally will have much of an effect on "awareness" of the
public at large.  So, what else is there?<BR><EM>-Jim Sinclair, Autism Network International</EM></P>

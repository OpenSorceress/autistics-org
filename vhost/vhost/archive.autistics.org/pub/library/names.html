<h1>Not Remembering Names Correctly</h1>

<p>
I have heard that this can sometimes have to do with CAPD, although I have no idea whether or not it is in my case.  I have a lot of difficulty remembering people's names (however, I also have a lot of trouble remembering their faces, which has more to do with prosopagnosia than CAPD).</p>

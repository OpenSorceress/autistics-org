<blockquote><p><em>"You know, it is not a fun thing to spend a couple of days giving comfort on the phone long distance with someone who thinks she's suffocating tied to a table somewhere, when you yourself are fighting off cold sweats and panic. It's even less fun when you realize that in a few years you might be on the same phone holding the same conversation, this time with the teen damaged by the parents and professionals my friend had tried to warn that day." - Laura A.

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE="+2"><STRONG>Spoiler:  Discusses abusive 
"treatment" and some of its results.</STRONG></FONT></P>

<p>They're doing one more atrocious thing to autistic people in the name
of helping us.  I know someone's got to do something, and I've got the
experience and the (theoretical) communication ability, so I set to work
trying to write about it.</p>

<p>I know I'm doing good work, because there's a certain feel to it.  
Stuff is whirling around in my head, long-dormant words are slamming
together, and I rush to get it out of my fingers fast enough.  If I stop
to think about it, I can tell my body's getting worked up about all this
-- I've long been able to recognize adrenaline in my system.  Maybe that's
helping me write.</p>

<p>I try to write about whatever the latest atrocious thing <em>actually
does</em> to the person subjected to it.  Because that's what all the
studies and claims by outsiders tend to be missing.  They look at
quantitative data; they don't care about ethics or the internal state of
their subjects.  They just want people to behave in a certain way -- be it
less aggressive, less overtly autistic, more social, or whatever else
they're doing -- at apparently any cost.</p>

<p>Then it sneaks up on me.  I've been dreading it in the back of my mind,
thinking maybe this time it won't happen.  This time I'll get everything
I'm writing out, to the right people, beforehand.  Sometimes I get several
full messages out, but often it's only a line or a paragraph.  
Regardless, it always happens.</p>

<p>There's no way out.  The walls have changed shape, but I don't remember
them ever having been another shape.  Sometimes there's people around,
usually telling me -- often in various roundabout fashions -- that nothing
I experience actually exists.  Sometimes I'm alone and can't remember the
last time I saw a person.  I hear screaming.  I try to shut my mind off.  
I know there's no point in looking for a way out, because the last guy who
tried to escape got dragged back and his clothes taken away from him.  I
curl up in a ball and start pounding my head on the nearest surface, or I
run around and start kicking all the doors.  And when I'm done kicking the
doors, I dive into the kitchen cupboard or hide under the bed hoping
nobody will find me.</p>

<p>Things get mixed.  I call someone on the phone for help, but I think
she's Jim the Evil Night Nurse and beg her not to hurt me this time, or I
just sit there terrified she'll discover that I'm bad.  I see my door, but
I don't see that it has a doorknob.  I see my apartment, but I think
there's no way out.  I lie down on my bed to get some rest but straps
mysteriously appear and tie me to it.  Terror is a constant, and my mind
keeps panicking long after my body's run out of adrenaline to fuel any
kind of physical panic.</p>

<p>Voices I'd just as soon forget pop into my head, and that's the worst
part.  "Nothing terrible ever happened to you.  Trust me.  If you'd
cooperate with us, we wouldn't have to do this to you.  It's your own
fault for manipulating us with violence.  Talking about what <em>you</em>
feel about the situation is pure self-indulgence, you're delusional
anyway."</p>

<p>These voices are echoed and amplified by a lot of feedback by
non-autistic parents and a few sparse-but-magnified posts by autistic
people, various places on the Internet.  They all say roughly the same
thing:  Extreme behavior calls for extreme measures.  It doesn't matter
what the measures are, and they change depending on the topic.  I hear
claims like "He <em>had to</em> be institutionalized."  (Oh yeah, and an
institution just springs up out of nowhere?)  "He <em>requires</em> forced
medication."  (And exactly <em>what</em> abrogates someone's right to a
lack of assault on their central nervous system?  I wouldn't wish that on
a mass murderer.)  "I <em>had to</em> hit him."  (<em>Now</em> we're
getting to the real rationale behind all of the other crap...)</p>

<p>I hear story upon story of extreme behavior that strongly resembles
mine (either in the past or in the present) used to justify any atrocity
one human can commit against another, <a
HREF="http://www.geocities.com/growingjoel/murder.html">up to and
including murder</a>.  I hear words like "severe self-injurious behavior"
and "extreme aggression."  Yet if I try to tell what happened to
<em>me</em>, I am told one of several things:</p>

<ol>
<li>I am nothing like the person in question, because nobody who can type
on a computer keyboard has <em>possibly</em> ever displayed such behavior or been
subjected to such measures.  (One word: BS.)</li>

<li>Things are better since the 1960s when I was institutionalized.  Or, if
they realize I was institutionalized in the 1990s, the places I was locked
up were all anomalies.  All six of them, in all four counties, all with
purportedly different "treatment" approaches.</li>

<li>My experience of the institution, drug, segregated classroom,
"treatment technique," and so forth is terribly unique and most people
<em>like</em> it.  (Err... no.  I wish it was, then I wouldn't have 
to write things like this.)</li>

<li>People like me either deserve what we get or leave people with no
other options.</li>

<li>Parents have an absolute right to govern the lives of their children,
up to and including abuse, things that cause permanent brain damage, and
sometimes even premeditated murder.</li>

<li>That rather than trying to highlight injustice, I am trying to make 
people feel sorry for me.  (Seeing as I have no use for pity, no.)</li>

<li>That they <em>do</em> feel sorry for me, or more often for my parents, 
but that their child is different (they may even enumerate several traits 
their child has that I also have or had, to prove, oddly, that their child 
is different from me) so it's justified to do these things to their child 
(even if it's not really justified to do them to <em>anyone</em>).</li>

<li>That I am perseverating, throwing a tantrum, communicating in an inappropriate manner, bitter, rude, mean-spirited, disgusting, thinking in black and white, or some other twisted and demeaning way of saying that I am autistic so what I say doesn't matter.</li>

<li>That people who love their children cannot also be abusive (and some of them 
call <em>me</em> a black-and-white thinker?)</li>

<li>That I'm being non-supportive.</li>

</ol>

<p>And that all amplifies the effect.  I start thinking that I deserved
everything that ever happened to me, and that nobody will listen to what I
have to say so I might as well not say it.  In an ironic twist, my
perceptions warp until I start believing that my perception of abuse as
abuse is warped.  But then I think:  Would I condone this if it were done 
to someone else?  Of course not.  I've just got all these psych nurses and 
shrinks swirling around my head.</p>

<p>Eventually the feeling of trappedness pervades everything -- there's no
way out of the institution, so there's no way out of the apartment, no way
out of hearing these scary people saying they want to cure us or drug us
or kill us or lock us up whatever else they want to do with us, no way of
changing anything because I'm stuck here until I die.  I revert to how I
was back then, when I wasn't tied down somewhere -- sitting in the living
room (which goes back and forth from being a living room to a dayroom) too
scared to move because if I move I'll be the horrible manipulative evil
person everyone says I am.</p>

<p>Eventually the terror wears me out and I'm too unfocused and exhausted
to write, often after having been up several days because I'm afraid if I
sleep something Really Nasty will happen.  Words won't happen, because
that requires translating thoughts to words, and that ability's been worn
out by continual overload and exhaustion.  Or sometimes I get a few words
but I'm too scared if I write them someone will pop up from the lockups
and tell everyone I'm delusional or a liar, like they did to me back then
(and to the girl who was raped and wouldn't keep quiet about it).</p>

<p>Then I berate myself for not doing anything, and go back to bashing my
head on the nearest convenient surface until I either pass out or lose
enough (so far, temporarily, somehow) motor or sensory functions that I
can't move that way anymore.  Which is, ironically but not surprisingly,
the precise sort of behavior that whatever the latest "treatment" is is
supposed to get rid of.  <strong>And they never, <em>never</em> get it
that just the <em>thought</em> of their so-called "treatments" can induce
the same behavior they're constantly insisting they're trying to
eliminate, in the people they're targeting</strong> -- or that their
"treatment" touches only our behavior, not our reasons for it.</p>

<p>And this is only a tiny fraction of a taste of what these "treatments", and the constant and widespread approval and condoning of them, do to me, which is only a tiny fraction of a taste of what these things do to thousands of other autistic people around the world.  That's the kind of thought that keeps me from sleeping soundly.</p>

<p><small>I found this on my hard drive.  It probably dates back to somewhere between 2000 and 2002.  I didn't publish it whenever I wrote it, probably for the reasons it describes.  It's been edited a bit for clarity, and I've added things at someone's suggestion, but is essentially the same as I found it.  It is unfortunately still relevant.</small></p>

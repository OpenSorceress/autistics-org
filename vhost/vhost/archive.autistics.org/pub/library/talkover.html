<h1>Interruption or "Speaking Over" People</h1>
</div>

<p>
In the past, I have highly offended some people because I appear to be deliberately interrupting them.  This is sometimes related to CAPD.</p>

<p>I have an increased tendency to "talk over" people when more than one person is talking or there is other background noise.  I interrupt and do not realise I am doing it, because I am not always aware who is talking and who is "supposed" to be talking. I was told by a man in my environmental studies class that he was offended by me because I always interrupted him during groupwork. There were seventy students, probably, in the class, and during groupwork most of them seemed to be talking at once. I did not know that this man was trying to talk, and sometimes I did but could not make the connection that his talking was more important than the other background talking.</p>

<p>This is part of my "foreground-background" discrimination problem.</p>

<p>At other times, if my ability to recognise speech as speech (and not just sounds) is fading in and out, I can interrupt when I think a person is done talking.</p>

<p>At other times, my "interruption" probably stems from something other than CAPD (like when I become too excited about a topic to notice the rules of conversation), although it is almost never deliberate rudeness or inconsideration.</p>

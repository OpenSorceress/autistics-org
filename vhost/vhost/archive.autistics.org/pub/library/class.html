<h1>Classroom Accomodations for CAPD</h1>

<p>
There are probably many classroom accomodations for CAPD.  However, since I was in college before I was diagnosed, I have only had a few of them.</p>

<p>
I have been offered a notetaker but have turned it down for various reasons.  This might be a good accomodation for some people.</p>

<p>
In one class, I had a group final exam.  I could not hear anything when doing groupwork, because there were a whole lot of people in the room, all talking at once.  For the final exam, the Disabled Students Services department arranged for my group to take the final in a separate, quiet room.  This worked well.  I did not have the option to be silent, incidentally, because participation was graded.</p>

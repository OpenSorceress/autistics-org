<p>
Because of CAPD causing an inability to discriminate between certain sounds, I also had difficulty articulating certain sounds.</p>

<p>
I made the "L" sound in the back of my throat, similar to a French "R" or Arabic "ghayn" (pictured above) sound, or sometimes like a gulping or swallowing sound.  I did not notice that this sounded any different from anyone else's "L", until it was repeatedly pointed out to me.</p>

<p>
I made the American "R" sound probably like a "Y" or "W" (I am not sure how it sounded) and again I did not notice that it sounded any different from anyone else's "R".</p>

<p>
My vowels were probably a little off (for America), and a lot of people commented that I sounded "British" or "Swedish" (I have lived in America my whole life, and my parents have American accents) when I was younger.</p>

<p>
I have listened to tapes of myself (my singing teacher taped lessons) and in some spots I cannot understand my own speech.  In some of the Christmas songs, I noticed that I was pronouncing "Lord" as "rhuhd" or "ghuhd".</p>

<p>
I eventually asked for speech therapy because of the incessant (and loud) teasing that my speech articulation problems brought about.  When I went there, I was shown precisely where to place my tongue to make "L" and "R" sounds.  After that, I made the sounds exaggeratedly ("I sound like a Speak N' Spell" was my first comment) but after awhile I more or less figured it out.  The speech teacher expressed surprise at how quickly I caught on once shown the tongue positions.</p>

<p>
In college, I had a roommate from Germany who was unable to pronounce the American "R".  I showed and described the tongue position for the American "R", the same way the speech teacher had explained it, and she was able to do it.</p>

<p>
Even years after speech therapy, I occasionally get odd comments about my speech.  It has been described as "muffled", "like you're trying to talk with something in your mouth", "slurred", "monotonous", or "mumbly".  This does not happen all of the time, but happens particularly when I am tired.  I do not know if this all has to do with CAPD, or something else, but I do still get comments on my speech sometimes.  Sometimes it seems to have to do with CAPD, because aside from "slurred" or "monotonous" sometimes, I usually cannot tell that it is any different from anyone else's speech.</p>

<H2>What to do if you suspect your child has NT</H2>

<P>
First, dont panic!</P>


<P>
Nowadays due to diagnostic advances, early intervention and carefully
tailored behavioural management techniques, there is no reason why your
child can not grow into an independent social being, develop a TOOM
(Theory of Other Minds), and in time, even develop some special
interests
and abilities to contribute to society.</P>


<P>
While Medical Science currently holds out little hope for any great
improvements in perceptual abilities such as hearing acuity, touch
sensitivity, etc, it is still possible for NT children to enjoy the
limited senses that they do have.</P> 


<P>
Rote drills such as Applied Behaviour Analysis with their easily
understood regimen of repetitiveness and punishment will do wonders with
common NT behaviours such as lying, teasing and faddishness.</P>


<P>
AS scientists are currently working on a new range of wonder-drugs -
Swarming Inhibitors (SI's) which it is hoped will prevent some of the
more
anti-social manifestations of NT such as a tendency to congregate in
mobs,
engage in vicious group character assassinations of outsiders, and in
the
extreme case to actually incite each other to mass acts of violence and
destruction such as wars, pogroms, lynch mobs and the like.</P>

<H2><A NAME="what"></A>What Is NT?</H2>

<P>
Neurotypical syndrome is a neurobiological disorder characterized by preoccupation with social concerns, delusions of superiority, and obsession with conformity.</P>


<P>
Neurotypical individuals often assume that their experience of the world is either the only one, or the only correct one. NTs find it difficult to be alone. NTs are often intolerant of seemingly minor differences in others. When in groups NTs are socially and behaviorally rigid, and frequently insist upon the performance of dysfunctional, destructive, and even impossible rituals as a way of maintaining group identity. NTs find it difficult to communicate directly, and have a much higher incidence of lying as compared to persons on the autistic spectrum.</P>


<P>
NT is believed to be genetic in origin. Autopsies have shown the brain of the neurotypical is typically smaller than that of an autistic individual and may have overdeveloped areas related to social behavior.</P>

<P>
Tragically, as many as 9625 out of every 10,000 individuals may be neurotypical.</P>

<P>
There is no known cure for Neurotypical Syndrome.</P>


<P>
However, <A HREF="help.html">many NTs have learned to compensate for their disabilities</A> and interact normally with autistic persons.</P>

<H2><A NAME="about">About This Site</A></H2>


<P>
This site is an expression of autistic <EM>out</EM>rage.</P>
<P>
About a year ago I learned I was on the autistic spectrum. Inspired by this discovery, I read everything I could get my hands on about the autistic spectrum. Much of it makes sense-- for the first time in 41 years, I had a description, albiet an unexpected one, that <EM>fit</EM> me.
</P>



<P>
But a lot of what I've found out there, mostly written by "experts" and "professionals", has been arrogant, insulting, and just plain wrong. My b&ecirc;te noire of the moment is finding my emotions described as "flat". As someone with considerably greater expertise in my emotions than the "experts", I can state unequivocally that my emotions are not "flat". They are different, yes, but they are most certainly not "flat."</P>


<P>
Perhaps tomorrow I'll be fired up over being described as "lacking empathy". Or I'll be outraged at an exceptionally clueless "training" method being inflicted upon autistic kids. Or maybe it will be some new paper written by some "expert" from the perspective that neurotypical perception is correct, and my brain is a genetic mistake.</P>


<P>
My brain is a jewel. I am in awe of the mind that I have. I and my experience of life is not inferior, and may be <EM>superior</EM>, to the NT experience of life. </P>


<P>
Hence, this "Institute". Persons on the autistic spectrum and NT supporters are invited to submit papers to the Institute, and to share your observations in <A HREF="guestbook.html">"Current Research"</A> (the guestbook).</P>

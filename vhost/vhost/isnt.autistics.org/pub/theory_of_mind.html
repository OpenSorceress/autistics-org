<h2>
NT Theory of Mind</h2></center>

<p><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always wondered about the NT mind -- how it functions,
what stimuli triggers the characteristic, non-autism "socializing", along
with the diverse social delusion that is encountered when one NT meets
another or a person with autism sees and greets them. It has been in my
18 years of studies and experience to present the ISNT with my theory of
mind.
<p>Mind you that my studies are yet from over -- there is more to be learned
from these common beings. I will be diligently studying and dispersing
information as I can rationally conclude from my work. (And perhaps save
my sanity.)
<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The basis of the theory revolve around two principles --
unlike the autism "Folk Psychology vs. Folk Physics" that the NTs so claim
to be autism, the true nature of the Neuro-Typical can be described as
follows:
<center>
<p><b><font size=+0>Folk Psychology<sub>(self)</sub> vs. Folk Psychology<sub>(others)</sub></font></b></center>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been my observation and study that
Folk Physics doesn't exist in the Neuro-Typical mind, or at least without
stressing social status (Example: College graduates make more money and
are more appreciated by society, or at least that is how the social delusion
is.), Folk Physics doesn't matter. While the Neuro-Typical is rather strong
with Folk Psychology<sub>(others)</sub>, the Neuro-Typical struggles with
Folk Psychology<sub>(self)</sub>. They obsess constantly about others,
and cannot see how they could ever do without.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp; The best way to see this theory be true is
to look deeply into the social interaction, where aesthetics, conspiracies,
and common trends are dominant in behavior and interaction. In adolescence,
these three evolve and even dominate day to day life. This signifies the
heavily obsessive behaviors of the Folk Psychology<sub>(others)</sub>.
Moreover, it also proves that this is the strength of the Neuro-Typical,
and anything leaning towards Folk Psychology<sub>(self)</sub> is inappropriate
(Especially showing that you are favoring yourself.), and the Folk Physics
is weird. But to compensate for the lack of Folk Physics and Folk Psychology<sub>(self)</sub>,
the Neuro-Typical prefers to tease and humiliate the Folk Physics adept
(This is true when people with autism and people with Neuro-Typicalism
interact.). But the amount of teasing and humiliation that a Neuro-Typical
does is dependent on the severity. The more severity in the Neuro-Typicalism
that a person has, the more likely the behaviors dominate their interaction
with people with autism.</font>
<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea of Folk Psychology<sub>(self)</sub>
is present the Neuro-Typical, and is often perceived as an ideal, such
as "the perfect weight" that is predominant in females and male athletes.
It is a common place for children with the syndrome to fascinate like those
who have Folk Psychology<sub>(self)</sub> in order to escape the reality
of their true self. This, in turn, shows two things: One, where social
delusion starts, and two, how much the Folk Psychology<sub>(others)
</sub>dominates
the Neuro-Typical. It also concludes why the Folk Psychology<sub>(self)</sub>
begins to dissipate... perhaps I stumbled onto something revolutionary!</font>

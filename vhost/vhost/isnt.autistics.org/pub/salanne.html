<H2>The Sal and Anne Test: Implications, and Theory of Mind</H2>

<P>
Author:  Dr.  Nick Riviera,  MD,  PhD,  FACP,  OT,  PT,  DDT,  DNA,  
ABBA,  LP,  CCCP</P>


<P>
Sal and Annie are in the same room.  Sal puts a ball in one of two 
baskets,  and then leaves the room.  Annie takes the ball out of the 
basket,  and puts into the other.  An NT child will have an unusual 
capacity (a "splinter skill") to see this as an opportunity for 
deception.  He or she will instantly realize that Sal will not know 
where the ball is,  and that he may be manipulated in this situation.  </P>

<P>
This splinter skill is sometimes synergistic with an 
obsessive-compulsive tendency to exploit it ad nauseum.  And,  as a 
further pathology,  there may also develop the conviction that it is 
wrong in others,  yet remaining blind to it in him or herself.  This is 
known as "Lack of Theory of Mind."  LoToM is lacking the ability to
read 
one's own mindstate,  while simultaneously believing that one can
intuit 
others thoughts without communication.  The latter can be said to
border 
on psychosis,  but this is currently a debated matter.</P>


<P>
It is important that NT individuals make use of their abnormally 
developed skills,  i.e. lying and deception.  For instance,  some 
occupations appropriate for NTs would be:</P>

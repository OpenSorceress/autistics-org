<H2>NT Social Skills Deficiencies: A Case Study</H2>




<HR>

<P>
<EM>Below is a prototype of an NT-afflicted researcher's
request, inspired by a recent
example posted to a mailing list:</EM></P>

<HR>

<H3>URGENT NOTICE TO LIST MEMBERS!</H3>




<P>
I am a post-graduate at X University, and I'm in a hurry to find a hot
new
research topic so that I can impress my peers and professors, and move
on
to a brilliant career managing people just like you.</P> 


<P>
I discovered your fascinating disability through the family of a cousin
of a
friend of a friend. I am deeply moved by the plight of all you
unfortunates, and I am determined that your situation should be brought
to
the notice of every relevant government authority, health professional
and
psychotherapist in need of extra funding or a new specialty.</P>


<P>
You will not be troubled with all the details of the purposes of my
research, and you may rest assured that you will never hear from me
again
once I've finished extracting your information. </P>


<P>
Please take a few hours to fill in as fully as you can:</P>

<OL>
<LI>What is wrong with your child?</LI>
<LI>List all his/her problem behaviours since infancy</LI>

<LI>List all the ways in which you are unable to cope as a parent</LI>

<LI>Include here a review of any literature that you have found useful to
be included in my bibliography.</LI>

</OL>


<P>
In order to be allowed to participate in this research, you will be
expected to make your child available for extensive blood tests, genetic
tests, IQ tests, and personality tests. </P>


<P>
Naturally we need to be certain that your child is a bona-fide sufferer
from this disability, and we will be scrutinising you carefully for
signs
of abusive parenting and Munchhausen syndrome.</P> 


<P>
You will be notified as to when to present yourself at our clinic.</P>


<P>
Thanking you in advance,</P>


<P>
etc</P>

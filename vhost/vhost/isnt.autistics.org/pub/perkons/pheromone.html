<P>
Preliminary research has revealed that the Social Delusion so
prevalent in Homo Sapiens can be traced to a pheromone. </P>

        
<P>
The Social Delusion pheromone is produced when a person feels
himself to be part of, and accepted by, a group of people.  When a
person -- for example, an autistic person -- does not feel part of the
group, he will not produce the Social Delusion pheromone. The
Vomeronasal Organs (VNO's) of people in the group will therefore have
no Social Delusion pheromone to react to.  Group members will
immediately perceive a Social Delusion pheromone non-producer to be an
outsider, and will behave accordingly.
</P>
        
<P>
The Social Delusion pheromone was discovered by placing
pheromone aggregators in the air exhaust vents of the Astrodome during
a football game.  The ISNT research team first considered using the 
pheromone collectors in Times Square on New Year's Eve but decided 
against it because of possible wind conditions.  The Astrodome proved 
a successful location for obtaining a plentiful supply of pheromonal
material.</P>

        
<P>
The resulting pheromones were purified at the ISNT
Laboratory. 
Since this breakthrough, an antidote (Swarming Inhibitor) has been 
found to deactivate the Vomeronasal Organ, making it insensitive to 
pheromonal influence.</P> 

        
<P>
It was discovered that the Swarming Inhibitor (SI), or VNO
deactivator, has an interesting effect on newborn elephants. The
baby elephant's VNO is typically activated by a pheromone produced by
its mother. This pheromone sends a signal to the baby's amygdala,
stimulating nurture-seeking behaviors. By exposing the newborn to a 
small amount of SI, we were able to cause it to back away from its
mother.  
Though the experiment was immediately reversed to prevent harm to the
newborn,
it's obvious that such experiments would be inappropriate for human
beings.</P>

        
<P>
The ISNT Pheromone Research Group was able to test their
conclusions at various sports events. Microphones placed in sports
arenas were connected to a computer that measured the noise level
produced by fans.  Where the aggregation pheromone was introduced, the
level of cheering went up 48%, whereas in areas where the Swarming
Inhibitor
was introduced cheering diminished to almost imperceptible levels,
and in
some cases, sports fans got up and left.  When interviewed about their
reason for leaving, many fans said that suddenly they didn't know
why they came in the first place.  One young woman said that she had
suddenly
started to laugh at the beefy looking guys running around in strange
costumes,
had felt self-conscious and had decided to leave.</P> 

        
<P>
The ISNT Research Laboratory has offered the U.S. Army the use
of the Swarming Inhibitor as a tactical weapon. It could be
crop-dusted over
the 
Serbians, for example, to destroy the nationalistic cohesion and
prevent them from attacking Bosnians and Muslims. The Army declined
this offer, however, because of the fear that some of this powerful
material might escape within the ranks of the U.S. Military, causing
the soldiers to forget what they are doing.</P>

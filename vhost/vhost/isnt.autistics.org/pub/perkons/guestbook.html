<b>Due to some personal observations and interest of my own, <br>
I'd be particularly curious to know if any research has been<br>
done which might correlate the very strange <br>
"Pheromone of Social Delusion", which you so eloquently<br>
described, with a propensity to seemlessly identify people <br>
one sees in random places at random times while using the <br>
face as a primary recognition clue.  My web site, <br>
not anywhere near as cleverly written as this one, gives <br>
some examples of the opposite of the affliction I talk <br>
about here.<br>
<br>
I should add for clarity that while I am not afflicted with<br>
the Social Delusion Pheromone, I am also not on the autistic<br>
spectrum.</b><br>

<b>We need more research on the whole clothing and hair thing. How is it that periodically large numbers of NTs suddenly look different from a few months earlier? This extremely wasteful habit of shopping and getting new hair styles in order to look defiant, yet conformist, is really bizarre and shows a fundamental flaw in logical thinking. </b><br>

Bay Area, Ca - Monday, August 14, 2000 at 20:28:10 (CDT)<hr>

<b>I would like to offer to possible topics for research by the institute. The first is the apparent "asshole" gene said to be found in NT males. This is supposed to be found in the female as the "bitch" gene.<br>
<br>
I have seen some isolated cases of specific behaviours that lead me to believe that in fact these conditions are not genetic in nature, however, they appear to be behavioural disorders falling somewhere on the spectrum of obvert social control obsession while manifesting deception without cause or reason and exhibiting group acceptance disfunction. Perhaps the ISNT has conducted some study on this?<br>
<br>
The other topic of interest could be termed, Asperger Syndrome, Dutch Disease? A comparative study on the Netherlands as being a social haven for autistics. <br>
<br>
In the course of this study there would be examples of the peculiarity specific to the Netherlands that are atypical of AS, namely the rail system, the canal system, the dyke system. Windmills, wooden shoes. Current climate of social tolerance to uniqueness in comparison to other western countries. The odd similarity in AS and Dutch women being the ridicule of the world fashion industry, yet possessing a natural beauty that is based upon truth and honesty. Why is it that Dutch people appear surprised when they discover an AS is not Dutch. What is going on in that peculiar country that everyone loves so much?<br>

<b>Thank you for a reminder that all people, even those with "disorders", deserve to be treated with respect. I realize that just as the autistic children I teach exhibit behavior that I find strange, they probably find my behavior strange as well. Right now they are learning how to care for themselves and to learn from their environment, and hopefully one day they will be able to express their viewpoints and experiences as eloquently and with as much humor as I found on this website.</b><br>

<b>Dear "Dr." Perkons,<br>
I strongly encourage a study into why some NT's don't bother to take the time to understand paraody. PARODY folks!!!  See the little disclaimer at the top - stating that this is "humor".  You know the thing that the autism experts said our children don't have. :)  Of course we all know that humor is the best medicine.  And I for one am grateful for the good doctor Perkons and Muskie for providing such a humorous and insightful website.  And if I wanted "reality" about autism - I sure wouldn't look to the Universities for it.  I love this site - maybe the NTs who don't "get it" are the ones who are delayed(?) I thought it was common knowledge to "always read the fine print" :)<br>
Ah but this is for research suggestions I see... How about studying why it is that we NTs (mother of a 6yo who helps me adjust alot) feel the need to be what we arent?  What is "keeping up with the Jones'" and who are they anyway? :)</b><br>

<b>Dear Manoj!<br>
<br>
   I am sorry if this silly piece of writing has caused some confusion.  There is really no Pheromone of Social Delusion, although other pheromones have been discovered in animals, and one human pheromone has been discovered.<br>
<br>
   In time, pheromones may be used to cure diseases and perhaps influence people in many other ways, but we can't know that yet.  It is far into the future.<br>
<br>
    I will send you an E-mail privately with the REAL information about pheromones that is available, and explain why I wrote this article.<br>
<br>
   Again, I am sorry if I caused some confusion and misinformation.<br>

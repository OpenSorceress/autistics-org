<H1>Description of the ISNT graphic</H1>

<P>
The ISNT graphic consists of the words "Institute for the Study of the Neurologically Typical", plus a line drawing of a cross section of the human brain against a grid pattern, followed by the quote: "The common belief that (persons) with pervasive developmental disorders are humorless is frequently mistaken" - Stephen Bauer, M.D., M.P.H.</P>

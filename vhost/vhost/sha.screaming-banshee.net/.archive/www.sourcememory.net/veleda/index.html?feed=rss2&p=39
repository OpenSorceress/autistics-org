		<description><![CDATA[As usual, a salient and welcome article.  Thank you, Max Dashu, for your and necessary and highly informative and necessary website.

What I have trouble understanding from the Hutton worship and Whitmore bashing, is how so many self-proclaimed pagans do not want to address the fact that that they have a long history, albeit mostly obscure.  I guess they&#039;ve never heard the saying:  Those who don&#039;t have a past don&#039;t have a future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I found this really interesting. I&#039;d been having trouble reconciling Hutton&#039;s views with the evidence for paganism in the middle ages given by http://www.gravenimages.com.au/ageofwicca.html. So your critique throws a lot of light on it - thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s unfortunate that Hutton and other shoddy scholars like him have created somewhat of a setback in the study of European witchcraft specifically and pre-Christian religious practices in general.  I remeber reading in several sources how witchcraft was never a religious practice and the notion that it was is debunk and such sources invoked Hutton.  Clearly all the evidence shows otherwise. Even the pre-Christian so-called &#039;Classical&#039; sources make reference to the religious practices of the common people and their priestesses who utilized magic. Thankfully we have scholars like Max to set things in the right.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[BDT!

I have long believed that Hutton has a scholastic bias and even an English bias on Pagan traditions. He does eceleent research nut seems a bit myopic for my tastes. It&#039;s good to see some people taking a better look at the folklore and the documented older traditions. It wasn&#039;t all born in the mind of Gerald Gardner.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Max!   I wish we had more people writing so intelligently about this subject.   

I just can&#039;t get over the kind of idiocy that passes for &quot;rigor&quot; these days.    It&#039;s like...all the Pagans are fighting each other to prove that they are not &quot;fluffy bunnies&quot;  (i.e. effeminate).   And so they rush to defend arguments that seem &quot;objective&quot; simply because they do not challenge conventional histories very much.   It&#039;s a way of boosting their own credibility by disparaging a more marginalized view.]]></description>

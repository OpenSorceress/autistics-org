		<description><![CDATA[Yes, the ibex (which i just found out is a mountain goat) is connected with goddesses, going back a long ways, and with Hindu Kish area women&#039;s assemblies at altars. I don&#039;t remember where i filed this info, but it&#039;s an important link. The Kalasha are very threatened now; their cousins over the Afghan border in Nooristan (formerly Kafiristan, land of the Pagans) were forcibly converted to Islam over a century ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow fascinating stuff. I am really insterested in knowing what types of ancient customs especially from &#039;Stone Age&#039; times have been preserved or kept alive today.

Concerning this particular survey of South and Central Asia, do you know of any corollaries with say the Kalasha people who are the only remaining &#039;pagans&#039; in Pakistan? The ibex seems to heavily figure among the peoples of the Hindu Kush and cis-Himalayan region. I remember womens dances on certrain festivals or occasions being common as well.]]></description>

								<p>One of the obstacles in researching women is the old language of masculine default, that enshrouds women in a supposedly universal  “man” or “men.” The phallacy of this becomes apparent anytime it’s necessary to differentiate between male and female: “One important  difference between man and other primates is that he menstruates instead of going into heat.”</p>
<p>This male-default usage, which has regrettably made a comeback with the anti-feminist backlash, really gets in the way of finding the truth in historical research. It obscures what is really going on. When your source speaks only of “medicine men,” it is impossible to tell whether a given culture only recognized males, or overwhelmingly males, or whether this is the outsider’s bias, as is typically the case.</p>
<p>So last week I was trying to verify if the Anishinaabe (Ojibwa) medicine name<em> wabeno</em>, always translated as “men of dawn,” was ever applied to women, or really was exclusively male. I did not manage to get an answer to this question, but while searching ran across this story. A white guy was attending a meeting of an Ottawa medicine society in Michigan over a century ago had a run-in with an Ojibwa medicine woman:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;as Mr Cass is said to have observed an old Ojibwa medicine woman, who had come up at each dance to actively participate in the exercises, he asked someone near by why this old woman took such an active part, as she appeared rather uninteresting and had nothing to say, and apparently nothing to do except shake her snake-skin medicine bag.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The woman heard the remark and became offended, because she was known among her own people as a very powerful<em> mitä&#8217;kwe</em>. In an instant she threw the dry snake-skin bag toward the offender, when the skin became a live serpent which rushed at Mr Cass and ran him out of the crowd. The snake then returned to the medicine woman, who picked it up, when it appeared again as a dry skin bag.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>W.P. Strickland refers to a medicine woman known as the &#8220;Prophetess of Che-moi-che-goi-me-gou” or &#8220;Blue-robed Cloud Woman.” Her fasting vision quest at menarche led to a vision that conferred spiritual gifts on her. On the night of the sixth day, a voice called her to walk toward it on a narrow shining path. She saw the moon on her right and the setting sun on her left. Her account has been  rendered in stiffly Victorian language, mangled even, but still beautiful:</p>
<p>“I beheld on my right the face of Kau-ge-gag-be-qua, or the everlasting woman, who told me her name, and said to me, &#8216;I give you my name, and you may give it to another. I also give you that which I have, life everlasting. I give you long life on the earth, and skill in saving life in others. Go, you are called on high.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I went on, and saw a man standing with a large, circular body, and rays from his head, like horns. He said, &#8216;Fear not, my name is Monedo Wininees, or the Little man Spirit. I give this name to your first son. It is my life. Go to the place you are called to visit.&#8217; I followed the path till I could see that it led up to an opening in the sky, when I heard a voice, and standing still, saw the figure of a man standing near the path, whose head was surrounded with a brilliant halo, and his breast was covered with squares. He said to me: &#8216;Look at me, my name is O-shau-wau-e-geeghick, or the Bright Blue Sky. I am the veil that covers the opening into the sky. Stand and listen to me. Do not be afraid. I am going to endow you with gifts of life, and put you in array that you may withstand and endure.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Immediately I saw myself encircled with bright points which rested against me like needles, but gave me no pain, and they fell at my feet. This was repeated several times, and at each time they fell to the ground. He said, &#8216;wait and do not fear, till I have said and done all I am about to do.&#8217; I then felt different instruments, first like awls, and then like nails stuck into my flesh, but neither did they give me pain, but, like the needles, fell at my feet as often as they appeared. He then said, &#8216;that is good,&#8217; meaning my trial by these points. &#8216;You will see length of days. Advance a little further,&#8217; said he. I did so, and stood at the commencement of the opening. &#8216;You have arrived,&#8217; said he, &#8216;at the limit you cannot pass. I give you my name, you can give it to another. Now, return! Look around you. There is a conveyance for you. Do not be afraid to get on its back, and when you get to your lodge, you must take that which sustains the human body.&#8217; I turned, and saw a kind of fish swimming in the air, and getting upon it as directed, was carried back with celerity, my hair floating behind me in the air. And as soon as I got back, my vision ceased.</p>
<p>&#8220;After the seventh day of my fast, while I was lying in my lodge, I saw a dark, round object descending from the sky like a round stone, and enter my lodge. As it came near, I saw that it had small feet and hands like a human body. It spoke to me and said, &#8216;I give you the gift of seeing into futurity, that you may use it for the benefit of yourself and the Indians-your relations and tribes-people.&#8217; It then departed, but as it went away, it assumed wings, and looked to me like the red-headed woodpecker.</p>
<p>“The first time I exercised the prophetical art, was at the strong and repeated solicitations of my friends. It was in the winter season, and they were then encamped west of the Wisacoda, or Brule  River, of Lake Superior, and between it and the plains west. There were,  beside my mother&#8217;s family and relatives, a considerable number of  families. They had been some time at the place, and were near starving,  as they could find no game. One evening the chief of the party came into  my mother&#8217;s lodge. I had lain down, and was supposed to be asleep, and  he requested of my mother that she would allow me to try my skill to  relieve them. My mother spoke to me, and after some conversation, she  gave her consent.</p>
<div id="attachment_69" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 198px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ojibwe1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-69" title="ojibwe" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ojibwe1.jpg" alt="" width="188" height="349" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Anishinaabe (Ojibwa) woman with ceremonial staff</p></div>
<p>&#8220;I told them to build the Jee-suk-aun, or prophet&#8217;s lodge strong, and gave particular directions for it. I directed that it should consist of ten posts or saplings, each of a different kind of wood, which I named. When it was finished, and tightly wound with skins, the entire population of the encampment assembled around it, and I went in, taking only a small drum. I immediately knelt down, and holding my head near the ground, in a position as near as may be prostrate, began beating my drum, and reciting my songs or incantations. The lodge commenced shaking violently, by supernatural means. I knew this by the compressed current of air above, and the noise of motion. This being regarded by me, and by all without, as a proof of the presence of the spirits I consulted, I ceased beating and singing, and lay still, waiting for questions in the position I at first assumed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first question put to me was in relation to the game, and where it was to be found. The response was given by the orbicular spirit, who had appeared to me. He said, &#8216;How short-sighted you are! If you will go in a west direction, you will find game in abundance.&#8217; Next day the camp was broken up, and they all moved westward, the hunters, as usual, going far ahead. They had not proceeded far beyond the bounds of their former hunting circle, when they came upon tracks of moose, and that day they killed a female and two young moose, nearly full-grown. They pitched their encampment anew, and had abundance of animal food in this new position.”</p>
<p>These shaking-tent ceremonies were held over much of North America. The written sources I had seen until now all implied that only men performed them, but this account by Blue-robed Cloud Woman proves that women carried out these sacraments as well.</p>
<p>Similarly, I had never seen any reference to women carrying out the yuwipi ceremony (the medicine person is tied up and wrapped in a quilt, the bonds being loosed in short order). Not, at least, until I read <em>Walking in the Sacred Manner: Healers, Dreamers, and Pipe Carriers-Medicine Women of the Plains Indians</em>. (Mark St Pierre and Tilda Long Soldier,New York: Touchstone/ Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995) which is extremely rich. I highly recommend it.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know the language, but did know that Algonkian languages, and probably most aboriginal North American languages, don&#8217;t make a gender distinction in pronouns. The problem i was describing is when white male sources apply the biases of their own language (culture) in their description. What i was trying to say is this is one of many distortions that creeps in that gives a wrong impression of Anishinaabe or other American Indian cultures by overemphasizing the masculine at the expense of the feminine.</p>

		<p>&#8220;White male sources&#8221; will continue to talk and say what they will, but we as Anishinaabe don&#8217;t worry about this, that is, if we truly understand ourselves through our world view as expressed through our language&#8230;</p>
<p>Basically, if you had asked a speaker, they would have told you that the term you were researching could apply to either a male or female, instead of trying to dig through documents only.</p>
<p>My understanding of that term is &#8220;One of the dawn,&#8221; again, no direct correlation to any one sex. Knowing the language of a people goes much further than one might think&#8230;</p>

		<p>Very true, however i did not have access to a Speaker. I place the highest value on Indigenous sources, but was not able to travel to search for Anishinaabe elders. Everything i do is provisional, since what you say about the written sources is on the money, and so i have to keep adding info as i find it. Language is crucial, no doubt about it.</p>

		<p>Wow. Talk about going straight to the &#8216;horse&#8217;s mouth&#8217;. LOL  Yes, I&#8217;ve long noticed that in my studies of Native American culture that healers and ritual leaders are always styled as &#8220;men&#8221; as if they could be only males, yet many sources I&#8217;ve read describe women. As a male I too get baffled at the obfuscation of women by male default language.</p>
<p>To Meshekigiizhig, what you say is true but you have to understand it can be difficult for scholars like Max or others to get in contact with actual Indigenous people or speakers of the indigenous languages.  It&#8217;s unfortunate but most sources on Indigenous Americans are still written by whites and distortions will continue to persist until actual Indigenous Americans like yourself will start publishing information about your own people.</p>

		<p>I am Native American with parents from two different tribes, and I was adopted by my biological mothers family.  I grew up knowing who my birth parents were and I knew that they were from two different tribes.  I found out years ago that my biological father&#8217;s family hated my mother.  I was invited to spend a weekend with my bio-fathers mother and I chose to go to my bio-mother&#8217;s wedding that same weekend.  My bio-grandma won&#8217;t take my calls or respond back too me, as well as any family member from my fathers side. Recently I have been scratched on my legs and upper body. I have had 3 miscarriages and recently I was choked until I almost passed out.  Everytime my mom tries to smudge me the sage won&#8217;t stay lit.  My mom believes that I have had a &#8220;Bearwalk&#8221; put on me, which in my tribe is a curse from someone who wants to do great bodily harm on you.  I am just looking for advice on what I should do. Please.</p>

		<p>First, don&#8217;t get caught in fear, which makes you more vulnerable. You don&#8217;t say what the traditions are but i wouldn&#8217;t be able to advise you for those anyway. However, you are a child of Earth and can always turn to Nature for protection. Chant any prayer, any song that brings you close to the Sacred, calling and asking for help. Do it at least twice a day, it isn&#8217;t about form, having some right words, but about the heartfelt call. Walk on the land. Offer a little tobacco to places where you feel the power is strong. Keep asking for help and guidance and protection. See yourself bathed in light, and all ill energies turned away from you, falling away and sinking into the earth. Wash yourself with salt water with the intention of clearing away the hateful energy, or with water perfumed with lavender or other essential oil. Sage is excellent for transforming negative forces; if it won&#8217;t stay lit, persevere. You can either get the little charcoals for burning myrrh or you can make your own fire and use those coals. Don&#8217;t be intimidated, your spiritual will and persistence will win out, can prevail, will prevail. It doesn&#8217;t have to be sage, it could be mugwort which is the same family, or cedar or sweetgrass. Ask for help from your ancestors, or any Beings you hold sacred, ask for guidance in your dreams. Even better if you can find someone who holds sweatlodges, who knows what they&#8217;re doing, and not connected with the hateful family. Take little patches of cloth, place tobacco into them and tie them up with prayers. Put them around your doorway, over or beside your bed. You can also take a cord, a new cord, yarn or string, smudge it, and tie knots in it to bind all energies intended to harm you. Put your prayers into the cord, and then place it somewhere, on your home altar, or in a tree hollow near your house, or in the ground outside your door. These are acts of intention that increase your spiritual protection. You have the power within you to turn this away, to send the energy back. You don&#8217;t have to take it. Just have faith in whatever you hold most Sacred, Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for help from that Source. Play spiritual music in your home. Avoid people who might harm you, seek out positive allies. Ask for good people to come into your life. Most of all, calm yourself, don&#8217;t panic, and take positive action with full faith.</p>

		<p>Dear Kyōshin,Thanks for your response. I&#8217;ve read your commnets several times now, but I don&#8217;t understand what it was about my post that might have caused you to be aware of your  spiritual homelessness.  To me, a home is something we make (are continually making), not something we find. And, right, who can whole-heartedly regret the comforts that industry has given us? I hope you don&#8217;t think I was, in some way, trying to pit a romanticized Native American culture against contemporary industrial culture. The festival was merely a backdrop for an experience that could just as easily have happened in an urban Christian church. However, I do feel that something like a harvest festival (from any culture) which acknowledges the change of seasons speaks more clearly to my personal emotional and mental world of late than a Labor Day holiday.My own Christian upbringing didn&#8217;t leave a bad taste in my mouth. My father is a lapsed Roman Catholic and my mother has been associated with the Methodist church for most of her life, but would probably simply identify herself as a Christian (who also reads books on Judaism and Buddhism). In my late teens and early 20s, when I began to develop a more sophisticated view of the social and political world around me, a period of distaste for Christianity began. Not a distaste for my parents&#8217; version of the religion, but for one that had the power to hold hurtful dogmas over others and refused to permit other ways of thinking and being. In my twenties, I jokingly referred to the  Christian Military Industrial Complex.&#8217; I think there&#8217;s still some truth to this term, in the US, at least. Even before my early adulthood, though, I had a basic sense that the churches I had attended up to that point were trying to contain something much greater than the ministers could even imagine; they were describing life in small words in such a shallow either/or way; there was a real lack of ease with mystery. I did a lot of camping during this time and my appreciation for the vast mystery of the natural world became my first religion of choice. Discovering the writings of Laozi and Zhuangzi in my twenties, and later Buddhism, opened up a religious world that seemed to acknowledge experiences and views that I developed before I had ever heard of such people or ways of thought/being. I have made peace with Christianity, though. My wife, as you know, is a Christian, but one, due to her Chinese Buddhist roots and own spiritual inclinations, has been deeply influenced by modern Dharmic writers and teachers. These days because of where I live, ironically, I spend more time in Christian churches than in Buddhist temples, and I feel quite at home  usually. The  home&#8217; I am constantly creating is surely filled with a lot of post-modern simulacra, but these are the building blocks we have. That&#8217;s one of the things I enjoy so much about Dōgen. He didn&#8217;t buy into the mappō (Age of Decline) narrative of his day or, at least, had a different answer to it in comparison with the other new schools of the Kamakura period. It seems like he figured a human living in 13th century Japan had just as much potential for enlightenment or delusion as one living during the time of Shakyamuni.</p>

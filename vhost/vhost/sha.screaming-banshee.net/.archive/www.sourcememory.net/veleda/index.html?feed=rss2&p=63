		<description><![CDATA[Dear Kyōshin,Thanks for your response. I&#039;ve read your commnets several times now, but I don&#039;t understand what it was about my post that might have caused you to be aware of your  spiritual homelessness.  To me, a home is something we make (are continually making), not something we find. And, right, who can whole-heartedly regret the comforts that industry has given us? I hope you don&#039;t think I was, in some way, trying to pit a romanticized Native American culture against contemporary industrial culture. The festival was merely a backdrop for an experience that could just as easily have happened in an urban Christian church. However, I do feel that something like a harvest festival (from any culture) which acknowledges the change of seasons speaks more clearly to my personal emotional and mental world of late than a Labor Day holiday.My own Christian upbringing didn&#039;t leave a bad taste in my mouth. My father is a lapsed Roman Catholic and my mother has been associated with the Methodist church for most of her life, but would probably simply identify herself as a Christian (who also reads books on Judaism and Buddhism). In my late teens and early 20s, when I began to develop a more sophisticated view of the social and political world around me, a period of distaste for Christianity began. Not a distaste for my parents&#039; version of the religion, but for one that had the power to hold hurtful dogmas over others and refused to permit other ways of thinking and being. In my twenties, I jokingly referred to the  Christian Military Industrial Complex.&#039; I think there&#039;s still some truth to this term, in the US, at least. Even before my early adulthood, though, I had a basic sense that the churches I had attended up to that point were trying to contain something much greater than the ministers could even imagine; they were describing life in small words in such a shallow either/or way; there was a real lack of ease with mystery. I did a lot of camping during this time and my appreciation for the vast mystery of the natural world became my first religion of choice. Discovering the writings of Laozi and Zhuangzi in my twenties, and later Buddhism, opened up a religious world that seemed to acknowledge experiences and views that I developed before I had ever heard of such people or ways of thought/being. I have made peace with Christianity, though. My wife, as you know, is a Christian, but one, due to her Chinese Buddhist roots and own spiritual inclinations, has been deeply influenced by modern Dharmic writers and teachers. These days because of where I live, ironically, I spend more time in Christian churches than in Buddhist temples, and I feel quite at home  usually. The  home&#039; I am constantly creating is surely filled with a lot of post-modern simulacra, but these are the building blocks we have. That&#039;s one of the things I enjoy so much about Dōgen. He didn&#039;t buy into the mappō (Age of Decline) narrative of his day or, at least, had a different answer to it in comparison with the other new schools of the Kamakura period. It seems like he figured a human living in 13th century Japan had just as much potential for enlightenment or delusion as one living during the time of Shakyamuni.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First, don&#039;t get caught in fear, which makes you more vulnerable. You don&#039;t say what the traditions are but i wouldn&#039;t be able to advise you for those anyway. However, you are a child of Earth and can always turn to Nature for protection. Chant any prayer, any song that brings you close to the Sacred, calling and asking for help. Do it at least twice a day, it isn&#039;t about form, having some right words, but about the heartfelt call. Walk on the land. Offer a little tobacco to places where you feel the power is strong. Keep asking for help and guidance and protection. See yourself bathed in light, and all ill energies turned away from you, falling away and sinking into the earth. Wash yourself with salt water with the intention of clearing away the hateful energy, or with water perfumed with lavender or other essential oil. Sage is excellent for transforming negative forces; if it won&#039;t stay lit, persevere. You can either get the little charcoals for burning myrrh or you can make your own fire and use those coals. Don&#039;t be intimidated, your spiritual will and persistence will win out, can prevail, will prevail. It doesn&#039;t have to be sage, it could be mugwort which is the same family, or cedar or sweetgrass. Ask for help from your ancestors, or any Beings you hold sacred, ask for guidance in your dreams. Even better if you can find someone who holds sweatlodges, who knows what they&#039;re doing, and not connected with the hateful family. Take little patches of cloth, place tobacco into them and tie them up with prayers. Put them around your doorway, over or beside your bed. You can also take a cord, a new cord, yarn or string, smudge it, and tie knots in it to bind all energies intended to harm you. Put your prayers into the cord, and then place it somewhere, on your home altar, or in a tree hollow near your house, or in the ground outside your door. These are acts of intention that increase your spiritual protection. You have the power within you to turn this away, to send the energy back. You don&#039;t have to take it. Just have faith in whatever you hold most Sacred, Don&#039;t be afraid to ask for help from that Source. Play spiritual music in your home. Avoid people who might harm you, seek out positive allies. Ask for good people to come into your life. Most of all, calm yourself, don&#039;t panic, and take positive action with full faith.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am Native American with parents from two different tribes, and I was adopted by my biological mothers family.  I grew up knowing who my birth parents were and I knew that they were from two different tribes.  I found out years ago that my biological father&#039;s family hated my mother.  I was invited to spend a weekend with my bio-fathers mother and I chose to go to my bio-mother&#039;s wedding that same weekend.  My bio-grandma won&#039;t take my calls or respond back too me, as well as any family member from my fathers side. Recently I have been scratched on my legs and upper body. I have had 3 miscarriages and recently I was choked until I almost passed out.  Everytime my mom tries to smudge me the sage won&#039;t stay lit.  My mom believes that I have had a &quot;Bearwalk&quot; put on me, which in my tribe is a curse from someone who wants to do great bodily harm on you.  I am just looking for advice on what I should do. Please.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow. Talk about going straight to the &#039;horse&#039;s mouth&#039;. LOL  Yes, I&#039;ve long noticed that in my studies of Native American culture that healers and ritual leaders are always styled as &quot;men&quot; as if they could be only males, yet many sources I&#039;ve read describe women. As a male I too get baffled at the obfuscation of women by male default language.

To Meshekigiizhig, what you say is true but you have to understand it can be difficult for scholars like Max or others to get in contact with actual Indigenous people or speakers of the indigenous languages.  It&#039;s unfortunate but most sources on Indigenous Americans are still written by whites and distortions will continue to persist until actual Indigenous Americans like yourself will start publishing information about your own people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very true, however i did not have access to a Speaker. I place the highest value on Indigenous sources, but was not able to travel to search for Anishinaabe elders. Everything i do is provisional, since what you say about the written sources is on the money, and so i have to keep adding info as i find it. Language is crucial, no doubt about it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;White male sources&quot; will continue to talk and say what they will, but we as Anishinaabe don&#039;t worry about this, that is, if we truly understand ourselves through our world view as expressed through our language...

Basically, if you had asked a speaker, they would have told you that the term you were researching could apply to either a male or female, instead of trying to dig through documents only.

My understanding of that term is &quot;One of the dawn,&quot; again, no direct correlation to any one sex. Knowing the language of a people goes much further than one might think...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know the language, but did know that Algonkian languages, and probably most aboriginal North American languages, don&#039;t make a gender distinction in pronouns. The problem i was describing is when white male sources apply the biases of their own language (culture) in their description. What i was trying to say is this is one of many distortions that creeps in that gives a wrong impression of Anishinaabe or other American Indian cultures by overemphasizing the masculine at the expense of the feminine.]]></description>

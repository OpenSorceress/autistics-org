		<description><![CDATA[A quoted paragraph below from your first Valeda post foretells what we are hearing from Egypt and Libya this week as world forces try protect civilians in Libya. We also heard the same claims of peace from our recent U.S. presidents as they falsely gave to wretched slavery and economic breakdown the name of peace.  History, not herstory, so clearly repeating itself this very day: Thanks, Max, for the clarity.

&quot;The Batavians prepared to battle the Roman legions, sending envoys to other tribes, urging them to join the rising: “It is by the blood of the provinces that the provinces are conquered.” All the tribes had reasons to wish for Rome’s overthrow, and some responded quickly. The Frisii and Canninefates attacked a Roman military encampment. The Tungrians soon joined them. Desertions of provincials from the Roman army enabled the insurgent tribes to destroy and capture an entire fleet of imperial ships. Tacitus wrote, “They became very famous throughout Germany as the champions of liberty.”[Historia, 4:17] More tribes came out openly against the empire, moved by Civilis’ reproach that “they falsely gave to a wretched slavery the name of peace…”]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a small detail to add about the fate of Veleda after the batavian revolt, a later resurrection of the tribe of the Bructeri lead to the total annihilation of teh tribe of the Bructeri, the tower of Veleda was tonr down until the last stone, and Veleda was taken to Rome.

As I understand she is supposedly held captive in a village outside of Rome where an ancient roman graffity was found that made a comment on her presence there. 

Sadly I do not know the exact references by heart.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mark,On the question of whteher permitting women deacons has  hurt  the RPCNA numerically, I doubt that there is anything more than conjectural evidence available.  The last debate on the topic that I can recall at the Synod level was in 2002, and it was resolved in favor of the same position that we have had since the 19th century.  I did not come away from that meeting with a sense that we were  evenly  divided, but I could be mistaken.I&#039;m not certain what leads you to believe that the denomination has been growing smaller.  The numbers for total membership from minutes of Synod statistics that I have handy are (1987)   4,912 total members, (1991) 5,186, (2002) 6,022, (2007) 6,403.  These are North American membership numbers and do not include the Japan Presbytery.  You would see the same trend if you looked at communicant membership or worship attendance.  The membership numbers last  bottomed out  around 1980 or so; as far as I am aware, the RPCNA continues to experience numeric growth by God&#039;s grace.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some years ago I read that doves = priestesses.. 
Your interesting page prompted me to search out something on that again and found :
&quot; Herodotus relates the story of two black doves who flew from Egyptian Thebes. One landed in Dondora and the other in Libya.&quot;  http://amirfatir.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/blackdoves.htm

there are other ancient sources that tell of the same.. 

Thank you, very interesting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A well under the floor, definitely. Very well said. I see no warrant however for the back-formation of a trinity in Hebrew tradition. Khochmah, Ruach, Rekhem, are all feminine words, and Khochmah especially was deeply connected to the ancient goddess Asherah, but the Hebrews did not combine them as a &#039;three.&#039; (Just as almah in Isaiah did not mean &#039;virgin&#039;; there was no prefiguration of christian virgin birth doctrine in the Hebrew Bible.) The Ruach Qadosha (Holy Spirit) that caused Maria to conceive was indeed linguistically female and symbolically (the dove) connected with the old Goddess religions. (Causing the comment in Philip, &quot;When did a female ever conceive by a female?&quot;) But she is no longer named as Goddess, and there is a politics to that. Goddess in her own right was ruled out of bounds, and where she does surface in the scriptures, she is only permitted as an aspect or &quot;emanation&quot; of the masculine god. She is hidden, absorbed, superseded. More on this here: http://www.suppressedhistories.net/articles/sophia.html 

Certainly an androgynous view of the Divine, whether combining or beyond gender, figures in many world traditions, from Mawu-Lisa of the Fon to Awonawilona of the Zuñi. Many goddesses such as Neith in Egypt or Mari of the Basques were seen as including masculine aspects. But i think to get past the patriarchal frameworks we need to re-envision untrammeled female Divinity -- not instrumentalized and narrowed and superseded as the theologians did with Maria, &quot;handmaiden of the lord,&quot; or as a portal for that power, but the awesome and limitless creative Being that the ancients knew.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, yes... Mother (of) Earth. But that is not enough! Surprisingly, in the core of patriarchal religion (christianity and judaism) lies a forgotten and surpressed possibility. Of God the Father becoming or beeing the Mother. The possibility of an androgynous image of God instead of splitting our worldwiev in two - Heavenly God the Father and Mother Earth, the Goddess. The Trinity of the Godhead for an example, is in old hebrew language out of feminine roots. Wisdom (hochmach, the child/daughter) and Spirit (ruach) and Compassion/Mercy (rechem, God in essence) are all strong words, and surely not masculinum words! The Lord of the fathers is described female. And the power that concived Jesus Christ is in the roots of language - feemale. As is the portal that birthed, and housed - Mother Maria. We have She above, and She underneath. Even where we see and preach only father-son-holy ghost. So I agree intensley... there is a well under the floor of &quot;young&quot; religions as christianity...]]></description>

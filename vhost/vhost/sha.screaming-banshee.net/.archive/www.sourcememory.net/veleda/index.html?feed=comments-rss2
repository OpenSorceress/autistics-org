		<description><![CDATA[You will be able to see Woman Shaman, since it is a dvd that will ship to Europe, and quite affordable. Some clips will be viewable online as well. I agree that the technology rests on some very distressing foundations, such as Apple&#039;s slavery-in-all-but-name factories in China. However, since the scientistic mechanistic worldview is a reaction to extremely destructive Christian dogma, i see them as connected, by contrast with Indigeous cosmovisions. Think of &quot;subdue the earth,&quot; and the continuities there in today&#039;s industrialized corporate feudalism. I see &quot;that beautiful image of God&quot; as part of the problem, because it was so thoroughly masculinized, hegemonic, and made separate from our consciousness and from the material world. Those schisms have to be overcome, in my view, and replaced with recognition of the interconnectedness of all things, &quot;All our relations&quot; as the Lakota say. A Christianity based in the Beatitudes would have been far less problematic, but as some have said, it turned into Paulinianity, with heavy infusions of Roman authoritarianism, which i personally can&#039;t relate to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mark,On the question of whteher permitting women deacons has  hurt  the RPCNA numerically, I doubt that there is anything more than conjectural evidence available.  The last debate on the topic that I can recall at the Synod level was in 2002, and it was resolved in favor of the same position that we have had since the 19th century.  I did not come away from that meeting with a sense that we were  evenly  divided, but I could be mistaken.I&#039;m not certain what leads you to believe that the denomination has been growing smaller.  The numbers for total membership from minutes of Synod statistics that I have handy are (1987)   4,912 total members, (1991) 5,186, (2002) 6,022, (2007) 6,403.  These are North American membership numbers and do not include the Japan Presbytery.  You would see the same trend if you looked at communicant membership or worship attendance.  The membership numbers last  bottomed out  around 1980 or so; as far as I am aware, the RPCNA continues to experience numeric growth by God&#039;s grace.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Kyōshin,Thanks for your response. I&#039;ve read your commnets several times now, but I don&#039;t understand what it was about my post that might have caused you to be aware of your  spiritual homelessness.  To me, a home is something we make (are continually making), not something we find. And, right, who can whole-heartedly regret the comforts that industry has given us? I hope you don&#039;t think I was, in some way, trying to pit a romanticized Native American culture against contemporary industrial culture. The festival was merely a backdrop for an experience that could just as easily have happened in an urban Christian church. However, I do feel that something like a harvest festival (from any culture) which acknowledges the change of seasons speaks more clearly to my personal emotional and mental world of late than a Labor Day holiday.My own Christian upbringing didn&#039;t leave a bad taste in my mouth. My father is a lapsed Roman Catholic and my mother has been associated with the Methodist church for most of her life, but would probably simply identify herself as a Christian (who also reads books on Judaism and Buddhism). In my late teens and early 20s, when I began to develop a more sophisticated view of the social and political world around me, a period of distaste for Christianity began. Not a distaste for my parents&#039; version of the religion, but for one that had the power to hold hurtful dogmas over others and refused to permit other ways of thinking and being. In my twenties, I jokingly referred to the  Christian Military Industrial Complex.&#039; I think there&#039;s still some truth to this term, in the US, at least. Even before my early adulthood, though, I had a basic sense that the churches I had attended up to that point were trying to contain something much greater than the ministers could even imagine; they were describing life in small words in such a shallow either/or way; there was a real lack of ease with mystery. I did a lot of camping during this time and my appreciation for the vast mystery of the natural world became my first religion of choice. Discovering the writings of Laozi and Zhuangzi in my twenties, and later Buddhism, opened up a religious world that seemed to acknowledge experiences and views that I developed before I had ever heard of such people or ways of thought/being. I have made peace with Christianity, though. My wife, as you know, is a Christian, but one, due to her Chinese Buddhist roots and own spiritual inclinations, has been deeply influenced by modern Dharmic writers and teachers. These days because of where I live, ironically, I spend more time in Christian churches than in Buddhist temples, and I feel quite at home  usually. The  home&#039; I am constantly creating is surely filled with a lot of post-modern simulacra, but these are the building blocks we have. That&#039;s one of the things I enjoy so much about Dōgen. He didn&#039;t buy into the mappō (Age of Decline) narrative of his day or, at least, had a different answer to it in comparison with the other new schools of the Kamakura period. It seems like he figured a human living in 13th century Japan had just as much potential for enlightenment or delusion as one living during the time of Shakyamuni.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read your essay on  Thrive , and have little chnace of seeing the film, as I live in Europe.While I agree with 99% of what you have written in the essay, I have a question about our current technology. First  I firmly  BELIEVE that our attitudes, our capacity to observe our world, and to feel part of it are a very potent antidote to the current spiritual crisis that is plaguing Western civilization. But as far as the technology is concerned, I now have doubts.It has evolved as an organic part of a belief system, a cosmogony which is propped AGAINST the traditional aspect of our Christian heritage (re Descartes). This tradition contained our greed, and exploitation of nature. The past 30 years have seen an unprecedented destruction of the containing effects of our religious tradition (I am not saying that our Christian tradition is all pie in the sky, far from it, but it had some definite advantages along with that depressing social control ).I am not sure at this time if our current technology is compatible with the new consciousness you are talking about. I have seen first hand the effects of this technology (computerization), outside of the much becried capitalistic setting, with the nice  good  employees, and the nasty EVIL bad bosses, and the bad news is that even outside the capitalistic setting, our technology definitely blights that  beautiful image of God that we were SUPPOSED TO BE, in the Jewish/Christian cosmogony.Care to comment ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As usual, a salient and welcome article.  Thank you, Max Dashu, for your and necessary and highly informative and necessary website.

What I have trouble understanding from the Hutton worship and Whitmore bashing, is how so many self-proclaimed pagans do not want to address the fact that that they have a long history, albeit mostly obscure.  I guess they&#039;ve never heard the saying:  Those who don&#039;t have a past don&#039;t have a future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First, don&#039;t get caught in fear, which makes you more vulnerable. You don&#039;t say what the traditions are but i wouldn&#039;t be able to advise you for those anyway. However, you are a child of Earth and can always turn to Nature for protection. Chant any prayer, any song that brings you close to the Sacred, calling and asking for help. Do it at least twice a day, it isn&#039;t about form, having some right words, but about the heartfelt call. Walk on the land. Offer a little tobacco to places where you feel the power is strong. Keep asking for help and guidance and protection. See yourself bathed in light, and all ill energies turned away from you, falling away and sinking into the earth. Wash yourself with salt water with the intention of clearing away the hateful energy, or with water perfumed with lavender or other essential oil. Sage is excellent for transforming negative forces; if it won&#039;t stay lit, persevere. You can either get the little charcoals for burning myrrh or you can make your own fire and use those coals. Don&#039;t be intimidated, your spiritual will and persistence will win out, can prevail, will prevail. It doesn&#039;t have to be sage, it could be mugwort which is the same family, or cedar or sweetgrass. Ask for help from your ancestors, or any Beings you hold sacred, ask for guidance in your dreams. Even better if you can find someone who holds sweatlodges, who knows what they&#039;re doing, and not connected with the hateful family. Take little patches of cloth, place tobacco into them and tie them up with prayers. Put them around your doorway, over or beside your bed. You can also take a cord, a new cord, yarn or string, smudge it, and tie knots in it to bind all energies intended to harm you. Put your prayers into the cord, and then place it somewhere, on your home altar, or in a tree hollow near your house, or in the ground outside your door. These are acts of intention that increase your spiritual protection. You have the power within you to turn this away, to send the energy back. You don&#039;t have to take it. Just have faith in whatever you hold most Sacred, Don&#039;t be afraid to ask for help from that Source. Play spiritual music in your home. Avoid people who might harm you, seek out positive allies. Ask for good people to come into your life. Most of all, calm yourself, don&#039;t panic, and take positive action with full faith.]]></description>

I grew up knowing who my birth parents were and I knew that they were from two different tribes.  I found out years ago that my biological father&#039;s family hated my mother.  I was invited to spend a weekend with my bio-fathers mother and I chose to go to my bio-mother&#039;s wedding that same weekend.  My bio-grandma won&#039;t take my calls or respond back too me, as well as any family member from my fathers side. Recently I have been scratched on my legs and upper body. I have had 3 miscarriages and recently I was choked until I almost passed out.  Everytime my mom tries to smudge me the sage won&#039;t stay lit.  My mom believes that I have had a &quot;Bearwalk&quot; put on me, which in my tribe is a curse from someone who wants to do great bodily harm on you.  I am just looking for advice on what I should do. Please.]]></description>

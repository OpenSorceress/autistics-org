		<description><![CDATA[The Cat Beings, Tigers, lions , panthers were Guardians for the priestesses, in that they were Guardians of the Dragon Lines-Fairy lines, or called ley lines by some people today.
The Dragon lines of mother Earth were and are the acupuncture points and it was the role of the Tribe of Danu and i am sure others to guard these energy lines and keep the energy in balance.
of course, as we know the Patriarchs took over these lines and nodes, built their churches etc on them in order to keep control over the feminine  Mother Earth herself.
The patriarchs used dark ceremonies in places like TaRa in order to keep wars going on Earth- even making sure wars, murder, pillage etc takes place in these areas- sacrifice to their gods.
I have learned from others that the missions did the same in USA and Canada etc.

Lastly, the good news is that liquid gold-illustrated as milk in old pictures is the food from the ether.......and this gold has been infused into all dragon lines last week in order to clense all the dark energies. Then a few days later the grid nodes were fired up- once again the fire of the priestess is used. This is to ignite the umbillical cord of Mother earth herself for her people.

I know this might sound insane to some people, but it is the old tradition of the people of Danu.

Blessings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi.

Reading about the lions reminds me of Mother Sekhmet and the Cat Beings from Egypt and her connection to Bru Na Boinne Ireland- the home of the tribe of Danu.

Car people also lived in USA and as far as I know were connected to the mounds - like Bru na Boinne.

Anyway, for those who are interested Mother Sekhmet &quot;energy&quot; has been activated at Bru Na Boinne 13th sphere stone, tone E.

Blessings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David, i believe that was part of Crystal&#039;s point. As to India, many scholars have proposed a borrowing of lion-riding goddesses from western Asia. That may be, but there is an indigenous strand centered on tigers, which i think entered in to the image of Durga riding on a tiger (sometimes a lion) and also influenced Tibetan icons of dakinis and goddesses (or yidams) riding on tigers. There are some clear west Asian influences on ancient Indian art, such as the Hurrian goddess type who shows up in the carved ringstones of 1st millennium bce India.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[^^ Actually Crystal, cats in European witchcraft or Old Religion were seen as &#039;familiar spirits&#039; or &#039;spitit guides&#039; of witches.  So when Christianity demonized witches, they naturally demonized cats as being harbingers of the devil.  I&#039;m not certain, but in a way the large cats like leopards and lions can perhaps be thought of as familiar spirits of the goddess.

My question to Max is that could there be a possible connection between the goddesses of Southwest Asia riding on big cats and those of India?? I have been researching Hindu goddess worship and I have covered some striking parallels between these and those of the &#039;Near East&#039;, particularly Mesopotamia.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Max! I&#039;m one of your students from the class you taught at JFKU, with Arisika Razak, on Goddesses. I&#039;m happy to discover you have a blog! I&#039;m also very glad to see that scholarship is starting to (officially) contradict Ronald Hutton&#039;s conclusions about &quot;witchcraft&quot; being a modern invention.

Anyway, reading this post about lion-throned goddesses reminds me of a statement Miriam Robbins Dexter made in &quot;Whence the Goddesses&quot; - that perhaps superstitions surrounding house cats (especially their associations with witches and &quot;crazy women&quot; ) stem from the original association of Great Goddesses with lions and leopards. In the medieval patriarchies, powerful goddesses were a fearsome threat to the power structure - and cats are &quot;miniature lions&quot; in a way.

Please keep up with posting these articles as I find the research absolutely fascinating. There is a *wealth* of information out there that only recently is being really paid attention to.]]></description>

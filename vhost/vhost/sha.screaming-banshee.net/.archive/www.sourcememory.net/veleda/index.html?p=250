“Four  Greco-Roman Temples of Fertility Goddesses: An Analysis of Architectural  Tradition,” 2007.</p>
<p><strong>Atargatis</strong><br />
Wimber compares the temples of Atargatis at Hierapolis and Dura Europos,  Syria, with another on the Aegean island Delos, a Jordanian goddess  temple at Khirbet et-Tannur, and the Derketo temple at Ashkelon. She  remarks</p>
<div id="attachment_255" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 171px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/atargatis94syria.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-255  " title="atargatis94syria" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/atargatis94syria-300x287.jpg" alt="" width="161" height="155" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Atargatis in her pillar aspect with ears of wheat. Syrian coin.</p></div>
<p>on the highly syncretic nature of this goddess, who blends old  Iraqi themes with Syro-Palestinian and Hittite influences. [34] I would  add that pillar goddess iconography from western Anatolia  became  especially influential. Atargatis is often shown in this form, closely  resembling the statues of Upis/Artemis Ephesia, Hera of Samos, and  others, on coins and in sculpture.</p>
<p>The best testimony about the Atargatis temple at Hierapolis comes from <em>De Dea Syria</em>, written by the Romano-Syrian Lucian of Samosata in the 2<sup>nd</sup> century ce. He says that Stratonice, wife of one of the Seleucid kings,  had the temple built around 300 bce. (Legend claimed that the architect  performed a self-castration to protect himself from accusations that  might arise from showing his royal patroness around the construction  site.) The great temple of Hierapolis stood on a hill surrounded by  walls and was entered through a colossal stone portal with two tall  columns beside it. [39-41] In front was a sacred lake with consecrated  fish.</p>
<div id="attachment_275" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 220px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/HierapolisAtargatis.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-275 " title="HierapolisAtargatis" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/HierapolisAtargatis-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="210" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Atargatis of Hierapolis on her lion</p></div>
<p>In the usual Hellenistic fashion, Lucian interpreted the goddess  through the lens of Hera, Aphrodite and Athena. The fact is that  Atargatis did not really fit any Greek template. She was thoroughly  Asiatic. (Wimber remarks, “In <em>De Dea Syria </em>Lucian can not even  decide which deity Atargatis represents&#8230;”) [114] The divine image of  Atargatis showed her seated on a lion throne next to her consort Hadad  on a throne of bulls. Lucian wrote:</p>
<p><strong>The sanctuary faces the sunrise&#8230;Within, the temple is not all of  a piece, but contains another chamber. It too has a low staircase: it  has no doors and is entirely open to the onlooker&#8230;In it are enthroned  the cult statues, Hera [Atargatis] and the god, Zeus, who they call by a  different name [Baal-Hadad]. Both are golden, both seated, though Hera  is borne on lions, the other sits on bulls. </strong>[78]</p>
<div id="attachment_258" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 206px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/BitHiluli.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-258 " title="BitHiluli" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/BitHiluli-218x300.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="270" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hebat on her lion, Tell Halaf (Bit Hiluli) Syria</p></div>
<p>This pairing is repeated at the sanctuaries of Dura Europos on the  upper Euphrates and at Khirbet et-Tannur in Jordan. It relates to older  temple iconography at ‘Ain Dara, which features the same goddess/lion  and god/bull thrones, and at Tell Halaf, where Hebat stands on a lion  and two gods on bulls.</p>
<p>Hierapolis (the “holy city”) was originally known as Manbug, from the Semitic root <em>nb’ </em>meaning  “to come out”. The name is interpreted as a pouring forth of water from  the rock. Devotees came to pour libations down a crevice in the rock  under the temple, said to be the place where the Great Flood was  swallowed up. This hilltop rock chasm points to a much older sanctuary  that must have pre-existed long before the  Seleucid temple was built.  [39, 43] Its water ceremonies continued, with processions carrying the  image of Atargatis to her sacred lake to be immersed, while others  brought ocean water to the temple. [57]</p>
<p>The temple of Derketo at Ashkelon also had such a lake. The Greek  physician Ctesias wrote down a story of how she turned into a fish after she leapt  into the sacred pool. Lucian related that people here revered Atargatis  as half woman, half fish, which is why they would never eat fish. He  also refers to rites in which  the statues of Atargatis and Hadad were  carried to the lake to see the sacred fish. The name Derketo is a  contraction of Atargatis. Little remains of her once-great temple now,  of the organized demolitions under the Christianized emperors of late  antiquity. (The coastal Palestinians resisted these temple destructions  with determination, as Ramsey MacMullen documents, and even afterward  refused to walk on the roads built with their stones.) But not all of  the destruction happened then. Wimber turned up a traveler’s account  of  seeing a sculpture of a naked woman surrounded by fishtailed figures in  the ruins of Ashkelon as late as 1697. [104]</p>
<p>Veneration of Atargatis spread throughout the Syrian diaspora, to the  island of Delos, where Syrian merchants built a temple to the goddess  in the 2<sup>nd</sup> century bce. It was laid out in the West Asian  style, and had ties to the priesthood of Hierapolis. Other Syrians  arrived on Delos, a major depot of the slave trade, as Roman captives to  be sold. Large numbers of these enslaved Syrians were shipped off to  the Roman plantations on Sicily. There they raised two powerful  insurrections in the name of Dea Syria, led by prophets of Atargatis.</p>
<div id="attachment_256" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 218px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/AtargatisHadadDuraEuropos100ce.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-256" title="AtargatisHadadDuraEuropos100ce" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/AtargatisHadadDuraEuropos100ce-208x300.jpg" alt="" width="208" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Atargatis with Hadad from Dura Europos, Syr</p></div>
<p>Coins from Hierapolis show Atargatis with lions.  A relief from  her temple at Dura Europos on the upper Euphrates shows her on a lion  throne, with her consort Hadad beside her on a bull throne.  Wimber  comments, “This arrangement strongly parallels the cult statue at  Hierapolis as described by Lucian—as does the lions flanking the throne  at Delos.” [48] She goes on to draw other parallels:</p>
<p><strong>One of the most important elements of Lucian’s account which the  relief of Hadad and Atargatis found at Dura Europos corroborates is the  standard with circles on it surmounted by a dove placed between the  deities. It is called the <em>semeion </em>by Lucian and interpreted to be  a symbol of the Babylonian queen Semiramis (c. 800 BC) who supposedly  founded the temple in another of Lucian’s foundation myths. An  interesting aspect of the cult revealed by the Dura relief is that  Atargatis was apparently more important that Hadad because she is  depicted as larger than Hadad and he appears pushed to the side and  behind her. This belief is underscored by the inscriptions at Delos  which mention Atargatis more often than her consort. </strong>[49]</p>
<p>Wimber also refers to “the relative importance of Asherah over Baal”  in earlier Canaanite settings. However, I question her statement that  “By the time of Lucian’s writings, Atargatis had lost many of the  attributes of Ishtar including her blatantly aggressive sexuality and  warlike character.” [38] We can not assume that these goddesses were  identical, even though their names have a shared etymology. The first  element in Atargatis is ‘Atar, an Aramaic <a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/EmesaCoin.tiff"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-260" title="EmesaCoin" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/EmesaCoin.tiff" alt="" /></a>form of the Semitic name for  the planet Venus. (The second element has been identified as ‘Ate or  ‘Atah, but its</p>
<div id="attachment_262" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/EmesaCoin.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-262" title="EmesaCoin" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/EmesaCoin-300x282.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="282" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Stone deity in temple. Coin from Emesa, Syria</p></div>
<p>meaning remains unclear.) The name first turns up in the  Annals of Ashurbanipal as Atar-Samain (Venus of the Heavens).</p>
<p>The linguistic constellation does reflect the co-gendered nature of  Mesopotamian Ishtar, in the sense that some forms are female, such as  Ashtart and Atargatis, while others are masculine: Yemenite ‘Athtar,  Moabite ‘Ashtar, and Ethiopian ‘Astar. Even Ishtar is grammatically  masculine in Akkadian, with the feminine form Ishtartu used in special  contexts. In several places, these related deities were represented by  betyls or standing stones. Ashtart-Aphrodite was revered at Paphos in  the form of somewhat triangular pillars, for which precedents are found  on the mainland, from Hazor to Arabia.</p>
<p><strong>Nabataea: ancient Jordan and north Arabia</strong><br />
The old Nabataean tradition was veneration of betyl stone and niches cut  into the rock. [50] This corresponds with two major Semitic traditions,  the Hebrews of Jacob’s time, who raised <em>matzeboth</em>, and the  Arabians up to the time of Muhammad, whose goddesses resided in standing  stones. Their Phoenician cousins practiced this too; a marble pillar at  Kition, Cyprus, was inscribed as a <em>massebah</em> to Astarte’s consort  Eshmun. [90] Wimber says the Nabataeans spoke Aramaic (or at least  their inscriptions were in that language, but that does not prove much,  since Aramaic was the chancery language across west Asia in the last  millennium bce).</p>
<div id="attachment_263" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/FishDeaKhirbetTannurTr.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-263" title="FishDeaKhirbetTannurTr" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/FishDeaKhirbetTannurTr-300x251.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="251" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Goddess with fish headdress, Khirbet et-Tannur, Jordan</p></div>
<p>The Nabataeans at Petra added Hellenistic sculptural icons, but in  their own completely unique style, to the older aniconic stones.  Al-Uzza, the goddess who represented the planet Venus and so  corresponded to Ishtar /Ashtart /Inanna, appeared both as betyl and  sculpture. Like Allat and Dushares, she was syncretized with the  dominant Greco-Roman deities and sometimes called by their names. The  influence of Atargatis is seen in the form of her sacred fish, which  crown al-Uzza in a temple relief at nearby Khirbet et-Tannur. [50-1] Sea goddesses with fish are  depicted in several Jordanian mosaics, with Greek inscriptions naming  Tethys or Thalassa.</p>
<p>Although it can be difficult to find much about the goddesses of  Petra—scholarly writings often concentrate on the god Dushares—Wimber  fleshes out the picture considerably:</p>
<p><strong>Al-Uzza was most likely the consort of Dushares while Allat was  his mother, and perhaps the mother of all the gods. In certain cases  Al-Uzza seems to have outstripped the importance of Dushares to the  Nabataeans as she is often depicted as the larger of two betyls.  Atargatis was not a</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_264" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 211px"><strong><strong><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/alUzzaPetra.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-264" title="al Huzza stela" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/alUzzaPetra-201x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="300" /></a></strong></strong><p class="wp-caption-text">Splitting the difference between betyl and sculpture at Petra</p></div>
<p><strong>native Nabataean goddess and one inscription under  an eye idol in the Wadi es-Siyyagh near Petra reveals that she was  numbered among the foreign deities worshipped by the Nabataeans. &#8230;  Nabataean religion remains a mystery and even the most notable scholars  in the field cannot decide who exactly was worshipped where and what the  attributes belong to which deities. </strong>[52]</p>
<p>While the original names are uncertain, Wimber concludes that the  Nabataeans at Petra venerated al-Uzza, Allat, and Aphrodite in the  Temple of the Winged Lions and, paired with a male consort, at Qasr  al-Bint Pharaon (an Arab name that means “castle of Pharaoh’s  daughter”). [75-6] I agree that the original deity names would have been  Arabian, not Aramaean. Wimber compares the betyl-goddesses of Petra to  the stone pillars of the old Hijazi goddesses, and cites Ibn al-Kalbi’s  account of chopping down three trees in the sanctuary of Al-Uzza, and  beheading the goddess on the orders of Muhammad. [92]</p>
<p><strong>Khirbet et- Tannur</strong><br />
The temple of Al-Uzza here was built in the 2<sup>nd</sup> century bce,  high on the hill Jebel Tannur and far from any city. [53] The temple  faced east. It began as a sculptured altar, which kept growing larger,  eventually reaching a height of over 10 feet. Old offerings were  incorporated inside its new stone facings. The (Syrian fate goddess)  Tyche, Hadad and Helios were carved in relief above the Corinthian and  horned Nabataean columns, which were combined with Egyptian cornices.  The inner shrine was entered through a portal surmounted by an  semicircular stone panel of the goddess. She is crowned with a tall  polos headdress with an eagle, yet her hair is unbound, flowing freely  around her face. Flowers, fruits, and greenery course around her and  adorn her neck, chest, and even spill onto her forehead.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/AlUzzaTympanumTr.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266" title="AlUzzaTympanumTr" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/AlUzzaTympanumTr.jpg" alt="The Goddess of Khirbet et-Tannum, Jordan" width="504" height="357" /></a></p>
<p>The Goddess statue of the inner sanctum was later demolished  with prejudice; only one foot, a lion and a bit of her throne survived.  The destroyers apparently considered her consort less threatening, since  they spared his statue. This special hostility seems to have been   prompted by misogyny, since here as elsewhere, the goddess was the more  prominent figurine of the pair, as the author comments: “Al-Uzza’s  prominence at Khirbet et-Tannur is demonstrated by her many  manifestations and demonstrates her preeminence over her consort Hadad.”  [54-6]</p>
<p>Here is a good summary of Wimber’s thesis:</p>
<p><strong>The key element which ties all the temples at Delos, Dura Europos,  Khirbet et- Tannur, and most likely Hierapolis, is their use of the  open-court Mesopotamian plan. The Mesopotamian plan, as used in temples  of Near Eastern fertility goddesses, has at least a 3,000 year history  from Eanna in Uruk, c. 3,300 BC, to the temple of Eshmun at Sidon, c.  400 BC. The choice of this type of plan by fertility goddess worshippers  in the Greco-Roman period is significant. The Mesopotamian temple plans  stand as testimonies to the power of tradition in the Near East and as  grounds to reinterpret past scholarly research which ignores the great  amount of tradition which remains in the temples alone, let alone the  cults as a whole.</strong> [63-4]</p>
<p>The far-reaching influence of these temples extended as far as  Afghanistan, where it is reflected in two temples at Ai Khanoum, circa  300 bce. Wimber also remarks on the remodelings that the Mesopotamian  temples underwent across three millennia, and the impressive staying  power of the ceremonies that they housed: “The continuing power the  cults practiced in Uruk even into Hellenistic times is evidenced by the  rebuilding of many of the temples and the continuation of cult functions  in Uruk.” [65-6]</p>
<div id="attachment_267" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 184px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/baalbek.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-267 " title="baalbek" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/baalbek-217x300.jpg" alt="" width="174" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The majestic ruins of Baalbek. When the Roman emperor ordered the temples closed, the Lebanese raised a rebellion to defend their ancient religion.</p></div>
<p>Kristina Michelle Wimber observes that the great temples at Baalbek, Lebanon, look  Greco-Roman, but points out that the deities “were basically Near  Eastern Deities with added Roman names such as Jupiter-Baal,  Venus-Astarte and Bacchus-Dionysus.” The tower in the Baal sanctuary,  too, was purely Asiatic. [62-63] Wimber adds, “It has also been   proposed that the Aeolic and Ionic columns derived from the volutes of   the gate-post symbol of Inanna and thus the feminine nature usually   associated with the Ionic column comes from this symbolism.” [81] So we   come around again to the pre-imperial earth-sanctuaries of the Sumerian   goddess.</p>
<p>I remember feeling disappointed, long ago, seeing the Greco-Roman  appearance of Asian temples from this period, but the history shows that  this influence is in fact a backwash. Over time I realized that the  Greeks had derived much of their temple architecture from Asiatic  styles, particularly the Canaanite voluted column which inspired Aeolic  and then the Ionic column (itself named for a coastal region of Asia  Minor).</p>
<p>The Canaanite style in turn owed much to the Kemetic lotus-pillars of  ancient Egypt. The Doric column, as well, did not originate in Greece,  but first appears in a funerary temple at Giza in the 3<sup>rd</sup> millennium bce, nearly two thousand years before the first columned  temples of “Greek” type—which appeared on Samos, off the coast of Asia  Minor, not in Hellas. The Corinthian column originated in a city so  famous for its Phoenician and Asiatic influences that Greek</p>

<p>classicists  regard it as ground zero for “orientalizing” (that word again), meaning that they copied from those cultures. If we  look back to those Canaanite societies, they themselves had earlier  become deeply impressed with Kemetic influences, to the degree that  statues of Baalat and other old Lebanese goddesses look like Isis.  Hieroglyphics are found on seals, the omnipresent sphinxes themselves  are modeled after Kemetic prototypes, the faces are stylistically  Egyptian, and Hathor appears again and again as Ashtart.</p>

<p><em>This is a quick whisk through a huge subject, or rather several  subjects, but all I have time for right now. I’ve stayed with the  outlines laid out in Wimber’s article, without going into large and important related  areas: the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and their spread of these  cultural memes across the Mediterranean; the massive Anatolian heritages  that predate and surround the Hurrian and Hittite and Ionian cultures;  the rich literature of invocations to Inanna and Ishtar, starting with  the priestess Enheduanna, the first author whose name is  recorded; the story of the priestesses themselves, and how male priests  gradually pushed them out of leadership positons and even the priesthood  itself over a long span of time; and the related issue of the temples under empire, and utilization of religion to legitimize and shore up rulers. African influence on the Canaanites  (whose languages, remember, belong to the Afro-Asiatic family) and for  that matter, the Greeks,  is another important area that I will  go into  more in future.</em></p>

		<p>The Afro-asiatic influence on the development of Greek civilization from pre-Hellenic Aegean times to Archaic Hellenic times is so profoundly obvious, one can just take a quick survey of the archaeology of these periods to see it. You don&#8217;t have to read the works of Martin Bernal like his &#8216;Black Spark, White Fire&#8217; to realize this. In fact, I don&#8217;t know what is so controversial about his works or others like it.  I thought mainstream academia has long acknowledged such influece on the Greece and the Aegean. In fact here are two excellent sources I came across some years ago:</p>
<p><a href="http://phoenicia.org/greek.html" rel="nofollow">http://phoenicia.org/greek.html</a></p>
<p><a href="http://theglitteringeye.com/?p=2757" rel="nofollow">http://theglitteringeye.com/?p=2757</a></p>
<p>Not only are there shared architectural themes with temples and shrines but even fundamental religious themes and beliefs like the coup d&#8217;état of male deities by their sons, sacred pillars and stones, sacred groves, sacred serpents and snake cults, demi-god culture heroes some of whom Greek legends specifically say are foreign, and chthonic monsters, all explained in the first link. The second link shows Greek hymns having Mesopotamian features.</p>
<p>In fact it is wonder why ancient Greece is NEVER labeled or classified as a &#8216;Near Eastern&#8217; civilization but a European one yet Egypt IS despite its culture being entirely African!</p>

		<p>I would like to thank the author of the article, Ms.: Wimber on these additions scientific Eastern religions and the impact the Greek civilization. You add and the contributions of old in this area and I&#8217;ve seen through the master&#8217;s thesis (Four Greco-Roman Era Temples of Near Eastern Fertility Goddesses: An Analysis of Architectural Tradition) My name is Omar Sarhan from Syria Write Master title (the goddess Atragatis in Syria and Rome during the period Romanian) or to communicate with Kristina to give a set of images and the results of modern excavations in Syria, especially the city of Hierapolis Manbej and others that would be helpful, and your articles and your own writing because they have learned a great eastern religion<br />
Thanks again</p>

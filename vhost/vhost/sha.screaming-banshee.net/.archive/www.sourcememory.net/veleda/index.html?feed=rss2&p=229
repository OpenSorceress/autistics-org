		<description><![CDATA[The basins aren&#039;t large enough to be mikvahs, but they definitely represent water in nature. I haven&#039;t heard anything about Anath temples, which proves nothing, since there is so little coverage of goddess temples period.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m the author of this thesis and just stumbled upon your review. I think this is great that you and those who read your blog are interested in this great topic. I just have to say in my defense I was just a 26 year old college kid trying to write a thesis and graduate. I&#039;m not a linguistics expert and definitely not a feminist scholar so although some ideas and use of language doesn&#039;t stand up to par with the greatest scholars in the world I I tried to do my best. So be gentle with the mistakes. Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s right! I forgot about the astronomical alignments. I believe the pools or basins are mikvahs and are based on natural springs or ponds.  You also brought up a great point about the confusion that arises from statements that Asherah, Astart, and Atargatis are somehow all the same deity.  I&#039;ve noticed this trend to lump up different goddesses together into one entity but never male deities, and I think it&#039;s more than just a coincidence in similar sounding transliterations but may tie into that trend of claiming the worship of a single goddess parallel to modern concepts of a single male god. Do you know of any temples dedicated to Anath?? I know that she is tied to the cult of Baal as his &#039;sister&#039; though her worship predates.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not to my knowledge, and not as discussed in the article reviewed here. But that is certainly true for some temples in other regions, most famously Malta. There are some indications of earth features, such as formalized mountains, trees, and the pools, tanks or basins, even the towers could have cosmological significance. The irregularity of layout that she discusses made me wonder if like the Egyptians they aligned the inner sanctum in such a way that starlight would penetrate. Kemetic architects would realign every so many centuries because precession of the equinoxes, or rather the polar wobble that causes this, caused these alignments to fall out of correct placement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Max, I&#039;ve long known that architectural planning in the ancient world is often ritually symbolic, and that is no doubt the case with temples, shrines, and other sacred buildings and structures.  What do you think the planning of these goddess temples represented ritualistically?  Do you think they somehow represent the female body in some way or another as some scholars have suggested??]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not offhand. This comes from conversations with Hebrew linguistics experts, re the word origin and different spelling, and my own observations based on parallels in Ugaritic and Hebrew literature (a bit from Egyptian too). I don&#039;t have all the references handy, they&#039;re sitting in bulky file folders. I suggest following up on the sources given at the end of Joanna Hadley&#039;s article, linked within my article on the Lion-Throned Goddess, third in this series.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely fascinating.  I&#039;m just jumping into the more academic discourse about Middle Eastern goddesses and this article is a great introduction to some of the complexities of the scholarship. Can you give any more resources which deal with this idea that Asherah/Athirat/Asheratu and Ashtoreth /Ashtart, Athtart, Ishtar are distinct goddess &quot;streams&quot;?]]></description>

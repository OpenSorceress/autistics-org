		<description><![CDATA[I am a devotee of the Black madoma , Lady ot the Myrtles, of Kythera Island, Greece. An icon resides in the large Metropolis Church in Athens, but her origin is Kythera Island, where she makes a pilgrimage to each village durinng Paska  then back to her sea side church afterward. See photos of this seasons procession on Barbara Gravelle FaceBook.  I find the reference of Persephone to La Dame de la vie
evocative of how male priests attempted to steal the sacred female statues and icons for the glory and the power of the Patriarchy.]]></description>

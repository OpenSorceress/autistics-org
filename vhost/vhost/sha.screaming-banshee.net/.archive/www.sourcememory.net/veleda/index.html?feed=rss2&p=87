		<description><![CDATA[The first written data (voice: andina) is in P. Englund&#039;s Lexicon 1873, who lived in Oganna (a Kunama marda village) in 1866-7 (the first swedish SEM mission was settled there between 1866 and 1868).
Possession is &quot;bina&quot; in kunama, but in East Sudan (see J. Boddy Wombs and alien spirits) and in the Highlands and in Somalia the name is zar.
See a bibliography in my article quoted above.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s hard to say for sure since there are no written records, but i think it is really ancient. And also widespread, since the Oromo in southern Ethiopia had something similar, which gave rise to the zar religion that spread over much of northeast Africa and into Arabia and other parts of southwest Asia. There are similar traditions further west too, like the pre-Islamic bori religion of the Hausa. But because the Kunama have remained a matrilineal and matrilocal society, i think they have preserved ancient cultural patterns more than most of their neighbors.]]></description>

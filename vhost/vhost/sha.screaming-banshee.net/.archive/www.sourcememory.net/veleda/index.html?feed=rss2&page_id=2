		<description><![CDATA[Looks very interesting. I&#039;ve covered much of the same ground -- am thinking you go into the White Lotus women and other popular shamanic-Taoist-Buddhist societiesin your &quot;Outlaws&quot; section --but always learning more. I would like to read it, although my reading pile is tall and so is my work load.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Max,

I&#039;ve been combing through your writing, and it&#039;s looking good for a book or two. I&#039;m especially interested in the articles about Chinese goddesses like Xi Wangmu. I&#039;m in the final editing stage on a book called The Fall and Rise of Chinese Goddesses, and am looking for comments, criticisms, or referrals. The chapter titles give a pretty good idea of the contents, and they are:

1. How a Texan Man Became an Admirer of Chinese Goddesses

2. The Yin Side of Chinese Civilization

3. The Legendary Age of the Goddess

4. The Original Partnership of Sexes

5. Deities of Living Lands and Seas

6. Goddess Realms of Prehistoric China

7. Confucian Myths of the Golden Age

8. The Fall of Chinese Women

9. The Goddesses&#039; Outlaws

10. Women&#039;s Powers in Popular Daoism

11. How Women Changed Buddhism in China and Tibet

12. Confucianism as a Cult of &quot;Mama&#039;s Boys&quot;

13. Family Values in the Warlord Age, and Now

14. Goddess Religions of the Modern and Planetary Age

If you or someone you work with would like to read parts or all of it, please send me a note. 

Thanks for your great work, and I hope to hear from you,

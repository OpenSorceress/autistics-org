<p><i>Isis the Healer, the Mistress of Magic, in whose mouth is the Breath of Life,<br />
whose words destroy disease and awake the dead.</i> [1]</p>
<p>Shamans are known for their power to heal. They may lay on hands, extract negative energies from a diseased person’s body or infuse it with life essences, chant power songs and curative charms, or make journeys in the spirit to find and recover the soul of traumatized people, thus restoring them to health. Much of the written commentary about “shamanism” focuses primarily on males, so much so that they give the impression that women’s participation is negligible. In stark contrast to this picture are the many world traditions that cast medicine women as the greatest healers, so powerful that they are capable even of bringing the dead back to life. We&#8217;ll look at this theme in Egypt, Mali, Greece, Finland, Manchuria, Korea, and Tibet.</p>
<p><b>Isis</b></p>
<p>One of the 10,000 names of Auset (Isis) is Weret Hekau, meaning the Great Enchantress, or “strong of magic.” One way that she heals is by words of power. This is how she restored the scorpion-bitten son of a lady in the Delta marshes. Auset is often depicted shaking the sistrum, the sacred rattle of Kemetic temple women, which itself has strong shamanic associations. (Some modern healers in Kenya, Namibia, and elsewhere in Africa, use gourd rattles in their curing ceremonies.) And Auset also possesses the shamanic power of shapeshifting into a falcon-form. She spreads out her protective wings, and beats them powerfully, to arouse vital spirit.</p>
<div id="attachment_629" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/AusetRevsAusar.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-629 " alt="Auset in the form of a kite bird beats her wings over the body of Ausar" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/AusetRevsAusar-300x173.jpg" width="300" height="173" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Auset in the form of a kite bird beats her wings over the body of Ausar, infusing life-force into the Stillheart.</p></div>
<p>To revive the slain and dismembered Ausar (Osiris), she changed into the form of a kite (a falcon-like bird with a flat, owl-like face) and hovered over his body. She “made a shade with her plumage / Created breath with her wings.” [2] Temple reliefs at Abydos and Denderah show Auset flying and beating her wings all around Ausar. Serpents of regeneration rise in the underworld beneath his bier. The deep-eyed Hekat, frog goddess of generation, birth and resurrection, watches over this transfiguration in the Denderah relief. [3]</p>
<p>Although Auset is indisputably a deity, she is also described as a First Woman, with an array of foundational acts to her credit. She is not only a model of queenship, but a powerful sorceress who is “mighty of tongue.” Her shapeshifting and power to restore the dead to life recur in numerous stories about powerful shamans. A very close parallel exists near the bend of the Niger River in Mali, where the great <i>tungutu</i> Pa Sini Jobu shapeshifts into bird form and uses her wings to impart life to a dead body.</p>
<p><b>Pa Sini Jobu</b></p>
<p>The Soroko people of Mali remembered Pa Sini Jobu as the greatest of all <i>tungutu</i>, their name for a shaman. She lived a very long time ago. “Pa Sini Jobu is regarded as the ancestress of a Soroko-Bosso tribe which dwells below Jenne ; she attained to extreme old age, and was a mistress of the most marvellous powers. Now, when she arrived at the time when women generally get husbands, she sent all her suitors away.  She had no desire towards marriage.” [4] Pa Sini Jobu’s abundant vital power is signaled by her very long hair and her preternaturally long life.</p>
<p>One day a man killed the sacred ram of the king, whose fortunes were bound up in the animal. The king sent out a desperate call to all the <i>tungutu</i> to come and revive him. “Then all sorts and conditions of men from the uttermost ends of the earth flocked together ; all who were Tungutu&#8230; some who could stay under water for three days. There were others who could stay buried in the earth for three days. There were people who could change themselves into fire. Each one tried his powers of wizardry. But the sheep was still dead; he gradually rotted and could not be made living and whole again.”</p>
<p>Then Pa Sini Jobu herself invited a <i>tungutu</i> named Yena to take up the task. He said he could do it if she was able to recover the ram’s liver and other body parts that the hyenas had devoured. Through her second sight, Pa Sini Jobu described the place where the jackals were holed up. She summoned them, and they came to her running. She commanded the jackals to retch up the organs. But the male <i>tungutu</i> was unable to do anything with these dead and chewed body parts. He said, “Thou hast brought back the parts that were missing by thy skill and use of powers, so that I cannot marvel at thee enough and I recognize thy superiority to me without more ado, but I am unable to restore the sheep to life.”</p>
<p>The King sent once more to Pa Sini Jobu, asking her if she knew of any way to revive the now rotting and stinking carcass of his ram. She agreed to help: “I will see to this matter myself. The sheep shall live.”  She set about her task through a classic shamanic ceremony of ecstatic dance:</p>
<div id="attachment_630" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/pasini.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-630 " alt="The tungutu Pa Sini Jobu dances with her staff as the Kie play music" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/pasini-300x268.jpg" width="300" height="268" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The tungutu Pa Sini Jobu dances with her staff as the Kie play</p></div>
<p><b>Thereupon the King caused all the Kie (musicians) to come together to beat their calabashes. The Kie sat around the square. Pa Sini Jobu took her seat on the ground in the midst of them. Because she was a Tungutu, she had such long hair that it reached far, far down her back, and she could sit on her own hair instead of a stool or a mat. This hair was the gift of her powers. </b></p>
<p><b>The Kie began to beat time. The Kie played music. They played and sang faster and faster still. Pa Sini Jobu began to get into a frenzy. Her power was awakened. The Kie played and sang and beat time with ever-increasing quickness. The power of Pa Sini Jobu grew stronger. Pa Sini Jobu screamed ! The Kie beat time. </b></p>
<p><b>Pa Sini Jobu rose up. She floated aloft. She floated up to the clouds. She changed her arms while up in the clouds into wings, like the great birds have, and then sank slowly down over the ram. Pa Sini Jobu rested over the ram for the space of six days. During this time she covered the ram with her outstretched wings. On the seventh day she got up. The ram was alive! </b></p>
<p>She had revivified the animal with her wings, as Isis did for Osiris.</p>
<p>After this exploit, Pa Sini Jobu left her country and traveled. She came to a country ruled by a woman, Queen Na Manj. The queen joyfully welcomed her with a stately procession at the gates of her city. All the townspeople came to greet Pa Sini Jobu, to bring her presents and do honour to her. Na Manj greeted the <i>tungutu</i> warmly, saying: “I have heard of thy great gifts. Do me the pleasure to stay awhile with me so that I may show how greatly I honour thee.” Pa Sini Jobu said: “Thou art very gracious. For a while I will stay with thee.” And she entered the city.</p>
<p>After a few days, Na Manj asked the Tungutu for her advice. She replied, “All that has happened is known unto me. Ask me, therefore, and I will answer thee gladly.&#8221; Na Manj said that she needed her help in fighting off a neighboring king whose warriors were disturbing her country. Pa Sini Jobu agreed.<b> </b></p>
<p>The king lived on an island in the Niger, and the river <i>djinns</i> tried to dissuade her, saying: “Thou art a strange Tungutu, great and mighty — in other places — but here thy powers avail not. Let it be, Pa Sini Jobu.” But Pa Sini Jobu only said, “We’ll see about that.” She went ahead with her ceremony, and the <i>djinn</i> swallowed up the queen and her entire army, leaving only the Tungutu. “Then the <i>djinn</i> took her under the water and instructed her about ‘all the illnesses and all misfortunes and all life on the earth,’ and how each could be remedied. These were teachings about ceremonially seating spirits in sacred pots filled with sacred and charged substances.</p>
<p>This keeping of spirit pots was widespread in West Africa, and the Yoruba and others disseminated it across the African Diaspora. [5] The spirits taking the <i>tungutu</i> “under the water” also compares to the San signification of “underwater” as the Spirit Realm of Ancestors, a timeless dimension where animals spoke to humans and where shamans accessed their powers. [6]</p>
<p>Another tradition of Mali briefly touches on this theme of a woman healer who has power even over death. The Nine Sorceresses of Mande appear in the epic <i>Sunjatta Keita</i>. The Ninth Sorceress is Kulutugubaga, who is able to restore broken arms, heal flesh wounds, and bring the dead back to life. [7] The poet says that all but one of these women fell dead at the coming of Sunjatta &#8212; and yet mentions them later, as if they were timeless and deathless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Medea</b></p>
<p>Medea of Colchis also was said to have revived a dead ram, but by putting it into a cauldron with potent herbs and incantations. All accounts emphasize Medea&#8217;s powers of herbs and enchantment, and repeatedly describe her as restoring life and youth. In <i>Nostoi</i>, she rejuvenated Jason&#8217;s father Aeson in a cauldron. Aeschylus has Medea revive the Nurses of Dionysos and their husbands with an herbal potion.</p>
<div id="attachment_633" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MedeaRam.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-633 " alt="Medea revives an old, dead ram in her cauldron of regeneration" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MedeaRam-300x223.jpg" width="300" height="223" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Medea revives an old, dead ram in her cauldron of regeneration. Greek vase painting.</p></div>
<p>But Euripides casts Medea’s restorative cauldron in a negative light. He makes her ram-rejuvenation into a ploy to convince the daughters of king Peleas to dismember and boil him, in order to make him immortal. Euripides also cast Medea as the murderer of her own children, against older Greek sources who named the Corinthians. [8] Thus Medea was demoted from a goddess, granddaughter of Helios, and the high priestess of Colchis (in the Caucasus), to a witch demonized for fighting back against powerful men.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another mystery solved. Thanks to the British Library’s online database  of Old English manuscripts, i’ve finally discovered what biblical  passage was illustrated by one of the most intriguing Pagan-themed  medieval drawings. It appears in the Harley Psalter, thought to have  been created at Canterbury circa 1020-40, as a copy of the 9th century  Utrecht Psalter. Here’s the picture (click to enlarge):</p>
<div id="attachment_596" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 582px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Harley603F56Psalm108.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-596     " title="Harley603F56Psalm108" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Harley603F56Psalm108-1024x681.jpg" alt="" width="572" height="382" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Illustration with Psalm 108, Harley Psalter, 603 F56</p></div>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure what biblical passage this illustrated, though i could see the word Psalmus, and now can make out the Roman numerals for 108. But the picture clearly reflected medieval Christian themes from Europe, and what has intrigued me since the early 1980s is its evocation of the clergy&#8217;s campaign against folk goddesses. This repression of female deities in popular religion is attested by numerous episcopal decrees and priestly confessional manuals, including the Corrector Burchardi, the Canon Episcopi, and earlier writings by Regino of Prum and Raterius of Verona.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on in this picture? In the lower panel, naked Pagans pray to a Goddess who is dancing on a stone. Beside her is a Tree of Life, which has a snake, garland, streaming libation vessel, and cornucopia. It could be argued that the Snake and Tree are inspired by Genesis, except that they are also common themes in Germanic religion, for example in the Matronae stones of the Rhineland (2nd-3rd century CE), and indeed around the world. So they predate the christianization of western Europe. The cornucopia originates with the Roman goddesses, particularly Terra Ops, Ceres, and Fortuna, whose bounty it symbolizes. (It  spread far and wide during the empire, not only to Britain, Gaul and Germany, but also to Egypt, added to the attributes of Isis, and into southwest Asia, also in association with goddesses.) Garlands were also widely used in animist ceremonies throughout Europe. As late as 1431, Jeanne d&#8217;Arc was accused of hanging garlands on the Fairy Tree for le beau Mai, the old pagan holyday of May Day. The inquisitors and theologians still saw this as a damnable Pagan act.</p>
<div id="attachment_606" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/danwitch1300s.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-606" title="danwitch1300s" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/danwitch1300s-300x220.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Caped witch riding tiger, Schleswig church mural, circa 1330</p></div>
<p>The goddess is bare-breasted, but her cape or mantle hangs from the tree. Some medieval images of witches (for example, a stone panel at Lyons cathedral, and a German church mural in Schleswig, near Denmark) show witches as naked women clad only in capes. They are riding on animals, or on a broomstick. It is this very theme of shamanic theme of women&#8217;s flight on the backs of animals that the clergy targeted for repression. They reinterpreted the Women Who Go by Night with the Goddess, in diabolist terms. The Goddess was &#8220;really&#8221; the devil. Advanced early on by church fathers, this doctrine persisted in Frankish texts about the worship of &#8220;Diana&#8221; (the <em>interpretatio romana</em> often obscured the names of local ethnic goddesses) or of &#8220;the witch Holda&#8221; (the German goddess Holle).</p>
<div id="attachment_607" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Lyons1330.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-607" title="Lyons1330" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Lyons1330-300x280.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="280" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Caped witch riding goat (and whirling a hare), relief from door of Lyons Cathedral. Directly opposite, another panel shows a lord in a castle tower ordering armed men with mastiffs to go after the witch.</p></div>
<p>The central theme in this Harley Psalter picture is supercession. The christian god-the-son is depicted above the goddess, as if replacing her. Not only is he placed above her spatially, but like her, he rests on a stone, and he too has the cornucopia streaming blessings. These are not Christian themes! but they were too deeply entrenched in the culture to be done away with. So they were appropriated as a step in the process of  supplanting Goddess reverence. Between the rival deities, a barebreasted woman tries to approach Jesus,  but an angel drags her away by her hair. I think this is significant since she is one of very few females in the Harley Psalter illustrations. You&#8217;ll note that all the other figures in the picture, even the Pagan worshippers and the angels, are male.</p>
<p>At lower left, soldiers are looting from a chest and kicking a man who is begging for mercy. Two of the Goddess worshippers are looking nervously over their shoulders at the soldiers, worried that they will be next. To me, this picture represents state attacks on pagans. Confiscation of their goods was one of the primary punishments, along with flogging and enslavement, for those who adhered to older ethnic religions  in the early middle ages. (It was primarily secular rulers who carried out these penalties, although priestly influence is clear, and bishops had powers both as secular and ecclesiastical lords.) The image comes from the portion of the Harley Psalter which was directly copied from the Utrecht Psalter. That would date the  scene to the 9th century, when such punishments were still widely inflicted on Pagans.</p>
<p><sup> </sup></p>
<p>The picture appears as an illustration to Psalm 108. At first, reading the psalm, with its standard exaltation of the Hebrew god, you might wonder: What does this picture have to do with that? The answer appears toward the end of the psalm, where the biblical god claims various territories in the land of Israel. Singled out for humiliation are Pagan lands in modern Jordan, traditional enemies of the Hebrews: &#8220;Moab is my washbasin,  on Edom I toss my sandal&#8230;<sup> </sup>Who will bring me to the fortified city?   Who will lead me to Edom?&#8221; In the mind of the monks who illuminated this manuscript, the common thread seems to be the conquest and suppression of Pagans.</p>
<p>The biblical psalm doesn&#8217;t say a word about goddesses, but the Harley Psalter (or its Carolingian model, the Utrecht) understands this supercession as being specifically the displacement of Goddess veneration by the Christian god. In another picture, he is exalted over Mother Earth who is shown submissively gazing up at him, surrounded by her sons (no daughters). She still has the cornucopia, from which watery essence is flowing toward a tree &#8212; and the bare-breasted Mother is wearing a cape or mantle.</p>
<div id="attachment_610" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Harley603EarthMa.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-610" title="Harley603EarthMa" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Harley603EarthMa-300x247.png" alt="" width="300" height="247" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mother Earth in the Harley Psalter, 603 F50</p></div>
<p>Eorthan Modor was just impossible for them to get rid of. She pops up even in the margins of Christian scriptures, on the ivory covers of prayer books, in murals of monasteries. In fact, she will outlive all human constructs &#8212; and that goes double for the concoctions of patriarchal theologians.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kebra Nagast (&#8220;Glory of Kings&#8221;) is the most important Ethiopian scripture. It describes the descent of Amharic kings from queen Makeda of Ethiopia and king Solomon of Judaea. (Sheba or Saba&#8217; encompasses  Yemen in southeast Arabia but also Ethiopia, where the Amharic people speak a closely related Semitic language.) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabaeans ">See map</a>) The story, compiled from various sources between about 400 to 1200, explains the origin of Ethiopia&#8217;s Solomonic line, including a claim that the Ark of the Covenant was spirited from Solomon&#8217;s temple to Ethiopia.</p>
<div id="attachment_573" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/makeda.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-573" title="makeda" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/makeda-300x259.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="259" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Makeda, queen of Sheba, wearing a classically African crown (other known examples are in bronze at Ile-Ife bronze and Sao ceramic sculpture, Lake Chad)</p></div>
<p>Hearing of Solomon&#8217;s wisdom from a traveling merchant, Makeda journeys to Jerusalem. After a colloquy with the king, Makeda declares, &#8220;From this moment I will not worship the sun, but will worship the Creator of the sun, the God of Israel.&#8221; The Sabeans were famed in both Hebrew and Arabic texts for venerating the sun, moon and stars. The time frame of Solomon&#8217;s reign is historically consistent with a powerful state in Saba&#8217;. So the Ethiopian queen converts to Judaism.</p>
<p>The next twist, in this text, is that before Makeda departs, Solomon tricks her into sleeping with him. She had asked him to swear that he will not force her into sex. He agrees, on condition that she wouldn&#8217;t take anything from his house by force. He feeds her a lot of spicy food, and in the night when she reaches for water in her thirst, he appears and says she has broken her promise, having taken water, the most valuable of all things. (What happened to the famous tradition of hospitality here? and how is this not coercion?) So, says the Kebra Nagast, Makeda assents to sex with Solomon. As she departs, he gives her a ring for their future son. Then Solomon dreams that the sun leaves Israel.</p>
<div id="attachment_574" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ark74.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-574" title="ark74" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ark74-300x196.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="196" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Queen of Saba&#39; and her entourage bring precious gifts to the palace of Solomon (unidentified Ethiopian manuscript, probably the Kebra Nagast)</p></div>
<p>Makeda bears a son, Menelik. When he comes of age, he goes to Jerusalem for his father&#8217;s blessing, and is recognized by the ring. Solomon wants Menelik succeed him as king, but he insists on returning to Ethiopia. So Solomon puts together a noble company to go back with him. Angry at being forced to leave their home and families, these young men secretly take the Ark out of the Temple and away to Africa. Menelik is not implicated in this deceit, but he finds out along the way. He is divinely transported back to Ethiopia through the skies, thwarting Solomon&#8217;s attempt to recover the Ark. (Here the ancient theme of Solomon&#8217;s straying into idol worship under the influence of his many foreign wives takes a new turn; it now becomes his attempt to console himself for the loss of the Ark.) Menelik&#8217;s return is celebrated with great pomp at Axum, and Makeda gives up her throne to him. (Natch!) Ethiopia becomes &#8220;the second Zion.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_575" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 238px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HolyMakeda.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-575" title="HolyMakeda" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HolyMakeda-228x300.jpg" alt="" width="228" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;The Holy Makeda&quot; as a saint and prophetess</p></div>
<p>The <em>Kebra Nagast</em> includes a magnificent passage where Makeda speaks of her search for Wisdom:</p>
<p><strong>I have drunk of her, but have not tottered; I have tottered through her, but have not fallen; I have fallen because of her but have not been destroyed. Through her I have dived down into the great sea and have seized in the place of her depths a pearl whereby I am rich. I went down like the great iron anchor whereby men anchor ships for the night on the high seas, and I received a lamp which lighteth me, and I came up by the ropes of the boat of understanding. I went to sleep in the depths of the sea, and not being overwhelmed with the water I dreamed a dream. And it seemed to me that there was a star in my womb, and I marvelled thereat, and I laid hold upon it and made it strong in the splendour of the sun; I laid hold upon it, and I will never let it go. I went in through the doors of the treasury of wisdom and I drew for myself the waters of understanding. I went into the blaze of the flame of the sun, and it lighted me with the splendour thereof, and I made of it a shield for myself, and I saved myself by confidence therein, and not myself only but all those who travel in the footprints of wisdom, and not myself only but all the men of my country, the kingdom of Ethiopia, and not those only but those who travel in their ways, the nations that are round about. </strong>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/afr/kn/kn097.htm ]</p>
<p>And then the Kebra Nagast returns to its central preoccupation, which is not Makeda herself, nor the wisdom of ancient Ethiopia of which she is the sole representative to be attested in written history. Instead, Makeda lays out the Solomonic line claim for the Ethiopian royal dynasty, a patrilineage going back to the Hebrew king. The book does credit her with building her capital Debra Makeda on a mountaintop. Other Ethiopian books give more details about Makeda&#8217;s parentage. The Ethiopian Book of Aksum describes her foundation of a new capital city at Azeba. Himyarite histories from Yemen also allude to this queen.</p>

Ethiopian MS.</p></div>
<p>At least one Ethiopian manuscript shows Makeda in connection with a labyrinth. One line in the Kebra Nagast, where Makeda speaks of &#8220;a star in my womb,&#8221; was undoubtedly intended as a reference to her future son and dynastic founder Menelik. But it can be read another way, as her womb in its own light: &#8220;And it seemed to me that there was a star in my womb, and I marvelled thereat, and I laid hold upon it and made it strong in the splendour of the sun&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The Biblical Account</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_577" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 221px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/solandsheba.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-577" title="solandsheba" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/solandsheba-211x300.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sheba, Solomon, and son: modern</p></div>
<p>The oldest account of the Queen of Sheba comes from the Bible, in the book of Kings. It does not give her a name. &#8220;When the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon and his relation to the name of the Lord, she came to test him with hard questions. Arriving at Jerusalem with a very great caravan&#8211;with camels carrying spices, tons of gold, and precious stones&#8211;she came to Solomon and talked with him about all that she had on her mind.&#8221; [10:1-2] He answered every question she asked, and the biblical scribe describes her  as being &#8220;overwhelmed&#8221; by his wisdom, and by the wealth and splendor of his palace and kingdom.</p>
<p>The Queen praised Solomon and heaped him with precious gifts: &#8220;And she gave the king 120 talents of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. Never again were so many spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.&#8221; [10:10] The account says nothing about sex or a son, but goes on to describe tribute paid to Solomon, and the glories of Ophir in Arabia &#8212; or Ethiopia. In this account, the Queen is a peer, not a subordinated or inferior figure.</p>
<p><strong>The Quranic Account</strong></p>
<p>In Arabia, the Queen of Sheba is named Bilqis. Among the ruins of Mar&#8217;ib is a Sabaean temple platform with eight pillars, sometimes called the Temple of Awwan. Yemenite tradition calls it Mahram Bilqis, her  &#8220;sanctuary.&#8221; The Qur&#8217;an also contains an account about the Queen of Sheba. Again, it does not name her. Even though it treats her being Pagan as despicable, she is described as great in glory. The hoopoe bird tells Suleiman (Solomon) about Saba&#8217;:</p>
<p><strong>Indeed, I found a woman ruling them, and she has been given of all things, and she has a great throne. I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of Allah, and Satan has made their deeds pleasing to them and averted them from [his] way, so they are not guided, so they do not prostrate to Allah&#8230;</strong> [Sura 27:24-25]</p>
<p>This passage reflects a memory of ancient Sabean queendoms with a strong dimension of spiritual leadership.</p>
<p>Suleiman sends a threatening message to Bilqis, “Be not haughty with me but come to me in submission.&#8221; Bilqis talks to her counselors, who say that they will go by her decision. She declares, &#8220;Indeed kings &#8211; when they enter a city, they ruin it and render the honor of its people humbled.&#8221; [27:35] This critique of warlordism is quite an extraordinary political statement for any ancient writing! and even more striking in being attributed to a woman ruler. The queen decides to send a gift, choosing the avenue of diplomacy, and to await Suleiman&#8217;s reply. He tells the emissaries that what Allah has given him is better than what they have, insults them for &#8220;rejoic[ing] in your gift,&#8221; and sends them back with a threat: &#8220;Return to them, for we will surely come to them with soldiers that they will be powerless to encounter, and we will surely expel them therefrom in humiliation, and they will be debased.&#8221; This is the declaration of a power-mad bully, not a man suffused in spiritual wisdom.</p>
<p>Before she set out to meet Suleiman, the Queen of Sheba locked and secured her throne. But the king sent a spirit to bring the throne to him, and disguised it, and tested her to see if she would recognize it. She did. Then Suleiman boasted of the primacy of his knowledge over hers. &#8220;And we were given knowledge before her, and we have been Muslims [meaning in submission to Allah, since this is all supposed to have happened fifteen centuries before Muhammad's time]. And that which she was worshipping other than Allah had averted her. Indeed, she was from a disbelieving people.&#8221; [27:42-43]</p>
<p>The Quranic account continues with a story symbolizing the ignorance of the pagan Queen: &#8220;She was told, &#8216;Enter the palace.&#8217; But when she saw it, she thought it was a body of water and uncovered her shins [to wade through]. He said, &#8220;Indeed, it is a palace [whose floor is] made smooth with glass.&#8221; She said, &#8220;My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, and I submit with Solomon to Allah, Lord of the worlds.&#8221; [Sura 27, from http://quran.com/27 <a href="http://shaikhsohail.wordpress.com/2008/06/18/bilqis-queen-of-sheba-stories-of-the-quran/">(Much more detail here</a> and <a href="http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2238&amp;Itemid=83">here</a>.) This passage shows the queen as exposing her body, considered as shameful for a woman, out of a misapprehension of the wonders in Suleiman's kingdom. But like the sibyls of Christian tradition, she also symbolizes a prestigious figure of the old pagan order, now made to yield to new supercessionist religions and their exclusively masculine prophets.</p>
<p>Sura 27 portrays a powerful Pagan woman in a shaming and subordinating light, but nevertheless comes the closest that the Islamic scripture gets to a female prophet in her own right. In the Quranic account, she is shown coming not to seek wisdom but to avert a disastrous invasion of her country. In historical reality, as archaeologists have been discovering, Solomonic Israel was utterly incapable of mounting such an invasion, least of all against far-away Yemen or Ethiopia. Little trace remains of the fabled palaces described by the Hebrew scribes; many archaeologists now think they are likely to have been humbler affairs, as there was never a Hebrew empire like that in the inflated biblical account.</p>
<p>Some medieval Arabic historians have Bilqis arriving at the throne not by inheritance, but by marrying a tyrannical king in order to unseat him. She kills him on her wedding night, addresses the people, and takes the throne by acclamation. Her role is heroic, although the writers seem unable to imagine that such a queen could have ascended to the throne in her own right. However, "the earliest inscriptions of the rulers of Dʿmt in northern Ethiopia and Eritrea mention queens of very high status, possibly equal to their kings."  [Wikipedia cite from this source, which bears further investigation: Rodolfo Fattovich, "The 'Pre-Aksumite' State in Northern Ethiopia and Eritrea Reconsidered" in Paul Lunde and Alexandra Porter ed., <em>Trade and Travel in the Red Sea Region</em>, in D. Kennet &amp; St J. Simpson ed., Society for Arabian Studies Monographs No. 2. BAR International Series 1269. Archaeopress, Oxford: 2004, p. 73]</p>
<p>Because the Queen of Sheba appears in the Qur&#8217;an, Muslims spread her story around the world. It became heavily mythologized along the way. Some writers claimed that the Queen was reluctant to uncover her feet because they were deformed, which is why Solomon tricked her into revealing them. But most versions say that Bilqis had the feet of a donkey. This motif belongs to a larger body of faery stories about magical women with the feet of deer (usually), or other hoofed animals, including camels. The glaisteagan of Scotland, huldres of Denmark, and &#8216;Aisha Qandisha and her company in Morocco, are just a few of them. In the Muslim context, as in the Christian, these stories impute a demonic nature to the spirit-woman (except where an old folk nature spirit motif remains strong).</p>
<p>Such stories were already in circulation in early medieval Islam, with famous theologians like Hasan Al Basri characterizing Bilqis &#8220;in a particularly pejorative way as an ‘<em>iljatu</em> meaning &#8216;she-ass&#8217; or &#8216;miscreant,&#8217; an expression frequently used to insult non-believers.&#8221; (He also insulted her appearance and declared women unfit to rule.) These ideas were common coin, with some going so far as to assert that Bilqis was a <em>jinn</em>, or the &#8220;mother of <em>jinni</em>.&#8221; ["Bilqis, Queen of Sheba. A democratic queen." Author unknown. www.asma-lamrabet.com/Articles/en/Bilqis%20english.pdf ] Even today, rumors circulate that the Queen of Sheba was really a <em>jinn</em>. (Google Bilqis, you&#8217;ll see.)</p>
<p><strong><em>Christian Representations of Sheba</em></strong></p>
<p>European authors and artists extend these subordinating narratives that show Solomon as not only the political superior of the Queen of Sheba, but also her spiritual senior and initiator. But now they add a racial distortion, whitening her; whether she came from Ethiopia or Yemen, the Queen of Sheba would have been a dark-skinned woman. This whitening can also be seen in Persian manuscripts.</p>
<div id="attachment_578" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/EuroKneeling.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-578" title="EuroKneeling" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/EuroKneeling-300x196.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="196" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Female pagan &quot;inferior&quot; before male superior: and de-Africanized at that</p></div>
<p>I haven&#8217;t done an exhaustive study of these representations, but a net search shows that they fall into two primary categories. The first shows the Queen of Sheba approaching Solomon from below, sometimes kneeling before him, or else ascending toward the king who is seated on a dais many steps above her.</p>
<div id="attachment_579" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/GerarddeJode.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-579" title="GerarddeJode" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/GerarddeJode-300x217.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="217" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The queen on her knees, by Gerard de Jode</p></div>
<p>Another theme appears in some of the art, however, one of parity and partnership, the true wisdom legacy of the Queen of Sheba. One of these is shown in Ghiberti&#8217;s Gates of Paradise:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<div id="attachment_580" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/solomon_and_the_queen_of_sheba_gates_of_paradise_04.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-580" title="solomon_and_the_queen_of_sheba_gates_of_paradise_04" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/solomon_and_the_queen_of_sheba_gates_of_paradise_04-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sheba and Solomon, Ghiberti&#39;s Gates of Paradise</p></div>
<p>We&#8217;re now at a moment where women of African descent are re-envisioning who the Queen of Sheba may have really been, beyond the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic scriptural traditions, within her original cultural context. What was the reality of ancient Ethiopian women? the oldest testimony I know of is the ancient megalithic statues of southern Ethiopia, in Sidamo and Soddo, all in the form of ancestral Mothers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Notre Dame de la Vie is a Celtic Goddess in a sculptural style that  strongly resembles two other goddesses who appear to date to the same antiquity. Their faces have similar features; so do their hoods or  headdresses. One of these sculptures is from Guernsey island in the  English Channel and the other is from Caerwent in southern Wales.</p>
<div>
<dl id="attachment_530">
<div id="attachment_530" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 211px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/granmere1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-530" title="granmere1" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/granmere1-201x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">La Grand-mère du Chimquière, Guernsey Island</p></div>
<p>La Grand-Mère du Chimquière belongs to a larger group of female  statue-menhirs from the late neolithic. Her name means Grandmother of  the Cemetery. She currently stands at the entrance of the churchyard at  St-Martin de Bellouse. (Funny, both she and Notre Dame de la Vie are  linked to the same  saint, the earliest christianizer in Gaul (d. 370  ce.)</p>
</dl>
</div>
<p>At one time a stone with two hollows for offerings lay before her,  but has since been removed. Nevertheless, the people kept up the custom of  garlanding her and placing offerings. “Even in the nineteenth century it  was ‘lucky to place a little offering of fruit or flowers, or to spill a  few drops of wine at the foot of the statue—‘c’etait une Pierre  sante&#8230;” (It was a holy stone.) [Kendrick, 17] These offerings continue today, as  many pictures online demonstrate.</p>
<p><strong>At one time the statue stood near the Church porch, facing East  but, probably because too much veneration was paid to her by  parishioners, a zealous churchwarden ordered her destruction.  It was  broken in two but such was the outcry that the statue was repaired and  placed in its current position.  A metal spike now holds her together  but the crack is clearly visible. </strong>[http://www.stmartinschurchguernsey.org/historyofthechurch.htm ]</p>
<p>This deliberate breakage (visible in the photo above) was committed in 1860,  around the time of the assaults on Notre Dame de la Vie. This period saw  another wave of concerted destruction of ancient goddesses of, in  Kendrick&#8217;s words, &#8220;long traditional sanctity.&#8221; The site quoted above  provides another crucial piece of information: &#8220;The church stands on the  site of a Neolithic tomb shrine below which two springs emerge.&#8221; So  this too is a fountain sanctuary.</p>
<div id="attachment_560" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 168px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Castel1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-560 " title="Castel1" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Castel1.jpg" alt="" width="158" height="293" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Megalithic Goddess at Castel, Guernsey</p></div>
<p>Another statue-menhir on Guernsey stands on a hill near the center  of the island, at Castel. In the 6th century a church was built on her  site, and she was buried in the area below its altar. So we see both  supercesssion (the new religion hiding and placing her beneath) and  incorporation (the would-be converts of that time knew that she was still there). In the late 1800s she was rediscovered and again placed outside. The Castel  statue-menhir is in the classic form of the megalithic era: a lightly  tapered stone pillar with breasts and  necklace. She also wears a  headband. Many French statue-menhirs have faces, but this one does not.</p>
<p>La Grand-mère probably looked similar, originally. But her head and  shoulders were recarved by Celtic hands, probably during the La Tène  period. They added a face, cut out her neck and sharply defined her  shoulders, and engraved a necklace or collar. None of these correspond  to any style of the megalithic period. (Thevenot compares her to another  breasted statue menhir enclosed in a wall at Lichessol, near  Saint-Agrève in the Ardèche region, whose head seems to emerge from a  round hood as well. But, no photos are available of her, so far.)</p>
<p>Another important, and comparable, Celtic statue is the Goddess of Caerwent.  She was venerated by</p>
<div id="attachment_561" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 187px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Gwent1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-561" title="Gwent" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Gwent1-177x300.jpg" alt="" width="177" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Goddess of the Silures, Caerwent, south Wale</p></div>
<p>the Silures, a Celtic tribe of south Wales. Before  the Roman conquest, they placed her in a deep ritual deposit pit, eleven  feet underground, on the grounds of a sanctuary that later became the  Roman temple at Venta Silurum. (The Roman name for Caerwent was Venta  Silurum, “marketplace of the Silures.”)</p>
<p>The sandstone statue presents a solemn seated woman holding a branch  in one hand and a sphere or fruit in the other. Her flat mask-like face  has its lips parted in a slight smile. Her somewhat triangular head is  longer than the minimal legs. (These proportions are common in older  Celtic sculpture in Britain and Gaul, for example a female statue from  Bourges.) The Goddess is naked except for a hood or cape set back on her  head. Her hands meet where her legs part, and at certain angles those  spindly legs look like a vulva-portal, with a deep hollow between them.  I’ve always thought of her as a proto-sheila. The worn surface of the  sandstone shows that she’s ancient, how old we have no way of knowing  for sure.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s compare the faces of the three goddesses or, in the case of la Grand-mère, ancestors. All represent an ancient Celtic style of stone carving that predates the Roman conquest. All have flat faces with large oval eyes and long noses and wear some kind of hood. Originally I was thinking that only Notre Dame de la Vie was associated with a spring sanctuary, but now find that so was La Grand-mère du Chimquière: &#8220;The church stands on the site of a Neolithic tomb shrine below which two springs emerge.&#8221; [from the offical website of St. Martin's Church: http://www.stmartinschurchguernsey.org/historyofthechurch.htm] And re-reading Anne Ross&#8217;s magisterial study <em>Pagan Celtic Britain</em>, I find that she thinks the Caerwent Goddess in Wales may have been connected to a healing shrine of the waters. [Ross, 247, 269] Be that as it may!</p>

<p>These photos show the close-set oval eyes with strong upper ridge, the long nose, and nearly identical mouths on the Guernsey re-carve of the statue menhir and on the Goddess of Life fountain goddess in Savoy. The hoods or headdress are also comparable. No frontal angle photo is available as of this writing for Notre Dame de la Vie, who bears many scars from mutilations inflicted in the mid-19th century.</p>

<p>Here the angle of the photos is more comparable. The face of the Caerwent goddess is more triangular but both have the same flatness, close-set oval eyes, and headdress. What I&#8217;m trying to do here is to show artistic patterns in ancient Celtic sculpture from an early cultural layer that predates the Roman empire and has gotten very little attention.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Saving the babies: fountain goddesses and respite baptism </strong></p>
<p>Another amazing aspect of the ancient sanctuary of Notre Dame de la Vie was as a compassionate place of refuge from harmful religious dogma. It became a <em>sanctuaire de répit</em>, or &#8220;respite sanctuary.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_547" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 305px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fontaine-miraculeuseRepit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-547" title="fontaine-miraculeuseRepit" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fontaine-miraculeuseRepit.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="288" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">French women immersing a baby in a healing well</p></div>
<p>Respite from what? &#8211;from the church doctrine of eternal damnation of those who died without being baptized. Notre Dame de la Vie was said to miraculously revive stillborn babies, or newborns who died before a priest could baptize them. People were bringing their dead infants for her intervention from at least the 1600s, as we know from records of hearings in 1664 and 1669. [197] Notre Dame de la Vie thus joined to a larger body &#8212; mostly local forms of the Virgin Mary &#8212; of female divinities who embodied compassion, mercy, and grace.</p>
<p>Church doctrine forbade the baptism of dead children, and held that they would go to hell. Toward the end of the middle ages, the idea of limbo was invented to soften the harshness of a dogma that caused so much suffering. Mothers already grieving their infant’s death could not stand the thought that it was doomed to be forever damned. Limbo meant the “edge” of hell, and the idea was that the babies would remain there, outside the torments of the damned, along with other good souls unsaved by baptism. But limbo has never enjoyed the status of church teaching. In any case, never being baptized  meant the baby would never enjoy the beatitude of heaven, but would spend eternity as an outsider. Limbo or no limbo, the clergy would not allow stillborns to be baptized or buried in consecrated ground.</p>
<div id="attachment_550" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 208px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/resu1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-550" title="resu1" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/resu1-198x300.jpg" alt="" width="198" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Attempting to revive dead baby for baptism </p></div>
<p>The common people refused to accept these cruel ideas. They sought divine intervention from another source, from Notre Dame de la Vie, or from the Blessed Virgin at other chapels that developed a reputation as respite sanctuaries. Parents would carry the dead child in all haste to the nearest shrine, lay it at the altar of the Virgin, light candles and ardently pray for its revival while a priest performed a rite.</p>
<p>All this depended on the participation of priests, because they had a total monopoly on baptism. Sometimes the vigil for revival would go on for days.  Any sign of movement, breath, change of color, or even passing gas or fluid—all of which are common biological occurrences after death—was taken as a miraculous resusciation or “recovery.” The priest would quickly baptize the child, and in virtually all cases, the child would die “again.” It would either be buried in a special cemetery at the respite sanctuary, or be taken home for burial in the village.</p>
<div id="attachment_548" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 174px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/BaptemeApresSuscitationRearWaitingforRepitInfantonAltarNotre-Dame-des-Fleurs-de-VillembrayOise.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-548" title="BaptemeApresSuscitationRearWaitingforRepitInfantonAltarNotre-Dame-des-Fleurs de Villembray(Oise)" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/BaptemeApresSuscitationRearWaitingforRepitInfantonAltarNotre-Dame-des-Fleurs-de-VillembrayOise-164x300.jpg" alt="" width="164" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Baptizing a &quot;revived&quot; infant at Notre-Dame des Fleurs de Villambray, Oise</p></div>
<p>The &#8220;respite&#8221; baptisms gave peace of mind to parents, and allowed children to be buried in consecrated ground. At St-Martin de Belleville, the record from 1664 says that an uncle brought a dead infant to Notre Dame de la Vie. The curé testified that the baby was seen to open its mouth and move its tongue around, and that its closed fist opened, extending its fingers. This allowed the vicar to baptize the baby, which lived several more hours. Then it was buried in a plot used for foreigners. [197-8] This indicates that the clergy involved still regarded the case as somewhat iffy. The priest performing the baptism would pronounce words to the effect of, &#8220;If you are alive, I baptise you.&#8221; The hierarchy were much more dubious about such cases, and put pressure from above to quash this practice.</p>
<p>The earliest evidence of respite baptisms comes from the late 13<sup>th</sup> century. Church condemnations of these grassroots miracles appear to begin in 1452 with the synod of Langres. Others followed, with denunciations by bishops at Sens (1524), Lyon (1577), Besançon (1592 et 1656), and Toul (1658). But the hierarchy was obliged to repeat its prohibitions over and over as the respite ceremonies spread. They were fighting a cultural movement fueled by love and compassion, that defied their directives.</p>
<p>People were flocking to respite sanctuaries from Belgium all the way down through eastern France and over into western Germany, Switzerland, Austria and north Italy. Most of these shrines of compassion were chapels of the Virgin Mary. Hundreds of cases are on record just for the 1500s and 1600s, just for the most popular chapels for these baptisms, such as Faverney, Avioth, and others in eastern France. By 1729 pope Benedict XIV was forced to rule on the issue, in response to a huge upsurge of respite ceremonies in Bavaria and Schwabia. He condemned the rites and backed up the Inquisition’s position that the “signs of life,” unless they were cries or moans, were not enough to allow baptism, no matter how many witnesses.</p>
<p>Emile Thevenot points to two Burgundian respite sanctuaries that “sprang up in places where there were traces of a defiant custom around a spring cult presided over by a mother goddess.” [197-8]</p>
<div id="attachment_549" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 206px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fr_holle.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-549" title="fr_holle" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fr_holle.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="216" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Frau Holle like Perchta was a protector of babies, including the unbaptized</p></div>
<p>And that is exactly what had happened at St-Martin de Belleville. As we&#8217;ve seen, this sanctuary openly retained the original Goddess who predates even the Roman conquest and was centered around a healing fountain. The refuge its Lady offered to dead newborns connects to widespread folk traditions of pagan goddesses who were seen as welcoming and protecting unbaptized babies rejected by the Church. People linked these &#8220;pagan babies&#8221; &#8212; in Sicily they were actually called <em>paganeddu</em>, in Germany <em>heiden</em>, &#8220;heathens&#8221; &#8212; to the old goddesses, like Zlata Baba in Slovenia, or to faery women, like the Danish huldra. [Dashu, 2007. <a href="http://www.matrifocus.com/IMB07/scholar.htm">Read more about folk traditions of the "pagan babies"</a>]</p>
<p>In the German Orla-gau, Perchta keeps little ones who died before baptism. She is ferried across the river with them, recalling Greek and Scandinavian myths of crossing the underworld river of death. Perchta is called queen of the <em>heimchen</em> (“crickets,” an affectionate term for the dead babies). One story says that she once lived in the fertile Saale valley. She fructified the land by plowing it underground, while her <em>heimchen</em> watered the fields. “At last the people fell out with her, and she determined to quit the country.”</p>

<p>So Perchta departed. Late on the eve of her holyday, the ferryman at Altar was confronted by a tall, stately lady surrounded by crying children. She demanded to be ferried to the other side of the river, and got into the barge. The <em>heimchen</em> loaded in a plough and tools, lamenting that they had to leave that lovely land. Perchta made the ferryman cross again to get the rest of the children. The whole time she was mending the plough. She gave the leftover chips as her fare. The ferryman only took three; by morning they had turned to gold. [Grimm, 932, 276]</p>
<p>Of course, these pagan loyalties, however stubbornly persistent, gave way to the Catholicized Goddess over time. But popular Marian devotion looked very different than the theologian&#8217;s concept of the Virign as intercessor. She acted much more like an alternative savior who repudiated the notion that infants who died in the womb or soon after birth were doomed, or at least outcasts. She embodied the compassion of the ancient Goddess whose successor she was.</p>

<p>An ancient stone goddess watched over a sacred spring at Saint-Martin de Belleville, on the French side of the Alps. Her veneration in Savoy goes back before the beginning of the written record. An influx of Celtic culture swept into this high valley of Doron de Belleville around the 400 bce, and it is full of early sites of the La Tène era.</p>
<div id="attachment_524" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 215px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/notredamedevie.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-524 " title="notredamedevie" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/notredamedevie-205x300.jpg" alt="" width="205" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Notre Dame de la Vie, before 1960</p></div>
<p>The Goddess statue was probably carved in the early centuries bce. She stands just over five feet tall, with a body that widens into a skirt at the base. Her eyes are large and close-set, with a &#8220;grave and meditative expression.&#8221; She holds a large cylindrical vessel over whose surface spill flat carved drops of water:</p>
<p>&#8220;These globules appear in strong relief, under each of her hands, three on one side, four on the other, and form a liquid flowing out of the reservoir, first obliquely, then vertically.&#8221; The sculpture symbolically conveys &#8220;the birth of a spring, over which the feminine deity presides.&#8221; [Thevenot, 194] The fountain poured into into a stone cist. Thousands of people came there to drink its waters, perform ablutions, and ask for healing and other blessings.</p>
<p>Over a long process of Christianization—one that was never completed—successive chapels were built at the spring sanctuary of this Goddess. In countless places around Europe, pagan sanctuaries were christianized by building churches on the spot, and bringing in a statue of Mary or another saint. But what happened here was exceptional. For nearly two millennia, an ancient Celtic goddess remained in her spring sanctuary, disguised under the Christian nomenclature of the Virgin Mary. She was given the thinly-christianized title Notre-Dame-de-la-Vie, “Our Lady of Life.”</p>
<p>The clergy moved the Goddess from her original position, probably among the rocks of the spring, and had her built into the foundation wall of the most recent of the chapels. Otherwise unchanged, the Goddess of Life continued to receive the devotions of Savoyards at her mountain spring. As Emile Thevenot says, “the church did not even ‘substitute’ the Marian cult for the mother-goddess, personification of the spring of Life. It was enough to discreetly juxtapose it, and the old statue continued to receive its due of tribute, even as the rite of ablutions was kept going.”</p>
<p>Veneration of the Goddess and her waters continued into modern times, when she was esteemed as a source of tremendous healing power. Records show that extremely rich offerings were being made at this shrine in the 1600s and 1700s (and doubtless many more humble ones). In the same time period, dozens of  murals were painted in the chapel depicting stories of miraculous cures by the Lady.</p>
<div id="attachment_525" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/St-MartindeBelleville.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-525  " title="St-MartindeBelleville" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/St-MartindeBelleville-300x206.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="206" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The spring water flowed into a stone tank, and in recent times was rechanneled through a pipe</p></div>
<p>The Goddess originally had full breasts. In the mid-1800s, a pious fanatic hacked them off—without doubt considering them too pagan, indecent, too full of naked female power. He left tool marks in the stone. Someone, probably the same person, also tried to drive a cross into her head, splitting the stone through the entire face of the icon. (This topping with crosses was often done to megalithic monuments and other known recipients of pagan reverence.) Someone drilled a hole into her neck, and passed a pipe through it to divert some of the spring water  through the opening. This did not work out well, because the photo above shows the ugly raw pipe bypassing the Goddess altogether. These damaging interventions made it necessary to patch the statue, with white cement visible in the picture above.</p>
<p>An eyewitness account from the 1930s describes one of the annual pilgrimages of to Notre-Dame-de-la-Vie. Savoyards came from villages near and far, often on foot, with their offerings and prayers. (One online account said that in the past surrounding villages pretty much emptied out to attend her annual festival in late summer. The chapel was furnished with special trunks for offerings of rye and wheat; people put cheeses and other dairy products near, and even on,  the altar. Live animals were tied up for later sale, with proceeds going to the chapel.</p>
<p>The witness saw women approaching a rough statue embedded in the wall that supported the chapel courtyard. The fountain poured into an old rectangular stone receptacle, the &#8220;tank of ablutions.&#8221; The women had brought clean linen to dip into the water and sponged their faces, eyes and breasts with it. Everyone regarded the water as “saving and fertilizing.”</p>
<div id="attachment_528" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Removed1960a.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-528" title="Removed1960a" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Removed1960a-300x298.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="298" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Goddess of Life after removal from the spring shrine</p></div>
<p>The Goddess of Life had survived christianization, medieval bishops, the Catholic Reformation, and even those 19th century mutilations &#8212; but not modernity. In 1960, church authorities removed the ancient statue from her place at the spring. They put her in a covered gallery, leaning against the west wall of the chapel. (Thevenot comments that this was “a real relegation.”) The Goddess no longer stood in the open air, and there was no longer room for people to gather around her. The receptacles for depositing offerings remained in place, but the pilgrimages fell off after the goddess was enclosed by the church. [191]</p>
<p>This move by the priests succeeded, at long last,  in driving popular veneration in a more conventional, doctrinal direction. It refocused attention to the chapel, adorned with standardized Catholic art.  It made Notre Dame de la Vie disappear from view, literally. The only pictures I&#8217;ve ever been able to find of her are in Thevenot&#8217;s book, written over 40 years ago.</p>
<p>Thevenot tells of another water goddess in the mountains of Savoy who survived under a Christianized veneer. The chapel of Notre Dame des Vernettes was built around another “miraculous and healing” spring to which people made pilgrimages. “We are assured that, even in our times, the ablutions, condemned by the hierarchy, continue to be practiced in an open or clandestine manner.” [194] So the struggle to suppress ancient cultural practices continues.</p>
<p>Lots of other pagan survivals exist in these mountains. La Pierre Chevettay (the “Owl Stone”) in the little hamlet  of Villarenger hamlet is a huge block balanced on a small square. On its  surface are six or seven cupules connected by grooved lines. People  said this sacred stone preserved the village from floods and fires.  It underwent the same de-paganizing indignities as Notre Dame de la Vie which, however, may have saved it from being destroyed entirely: “Numerous crosses were engraved on it to christianize this magic stone.”  [192]</p>
<p>Going further afield, Madonnas in other parts of France were often located near springs and wells. The Black Virgins of Rocamadour, Vassivieres, Cusset, Clermont and Chartres all stood near wells or</p>
<div id="attachment_529" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 166px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Vierge-noire-Notre-Dame-Vassiviere.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-529" title="Vierge noire Notre Dame Vassiviere" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Vierge-noire-Notre-Dame-Vassiviere.jpg" alt="" width="156" height="271" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Black Madonna of Vassivières, Auvergne</p></div>
<p>fountains. In Clermont, the tiny, very old black statue of Notre Dame du Port stood at a subterranean altar next to a sacred well. The Lady of la Font Sainte (“holy spring”) was carried in procession to and from her summer and winter shrines.</p>
<p>A legend from around 1400 describes how similar processions with the image of Notre Dame de Vassivières originated in a struggle between the peasants and clergy. The highland altar of the Black Madonna of Vassivières stands near an ancient spring venerated since Celtic times. Ecclesiastics removed her statue down the mountain to a church in the town of Besse. &#8220;Here the priests could keep an eye on her, rather than leave her in the hands of the laity in her outdoor shrine in the cow herding hamlet.&#8221; ["Vassivière"] But she soon vanished from the church. An old woman bringing her cow to the town market told people that the Lady had reappeared over the sacred fountain in the heights.</p>
<p>A tug-of-war followed: the priests kept taking the goddess to the church in Besse but the peasants always managed to smuggle her back to Vassivières. Finally the clergy struck a compromise with the rural people that allowed her to stay the summer in her highland sanctuary, but to spend winters at the Besse church, in captivity like Persephone. [from Frances Marion Gostling, <em>Auvergne and Its People</em>, 1935] The church set a new condition for allowing the Lady to return to her mountain: a priest had to be present to supervise what people did. A report from 1321 refers to the practice of many &#8220;profane and inappropriate&#8221; things of Vassivières. &#8220;They say strange things were practiced here. We don&#8217;t know what.&#8221; ["Vassivière"]</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While putting together a new visual talk on Ancient Central Europe (a very disregarded corner of history) one of the themes that emerged was lunar crescents. Clay sculptures known as Mondhörner, &#8220;moon-horns&#8221; have been found in Switzerland, dating to about 1500-900 bce, from what i&#8217;ve been able to determine so far.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<div id="attachment_498" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MoonHornLZurich.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-498 " title="MoonHornLZurich" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MoonHornLZurich-300x202.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="202" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Moonhorn, lake Zurich</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;">Some are pure crescents, like the above, others are stands with two or three legs.<br />
This example shows how like an animal&#8217;s horns some of them appear.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Others are more clearly crescents, or even appear shiplike:</p>
<div id="attachment_499" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MoonhornsMörigen900bce.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-499" title="MoonhornsMörigen900bce" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MoonhornsMörigen900bce-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Moonhorns, Mörigen, 900 bce</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;">They are often marked with symbols, line patterns, indentations and swirls.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<div id="attachment_500" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Moonhorn.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-500" title="Moonhorn" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Moonhorn-300x210.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="210" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Moonhorn with three legs, findspot unknown</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;">They&#8217;ve been compared to &#8220;Cretan horns of consecration.&#8221; Some have speculated that they were firedogs (hearth supports for logs) but this utilitarian explanation does not account for the careful decoration, nor for the appearance of the clay crescents in other contexts. Here is a clearly related pot-lid from France in the same time period:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<div id="attachment_501" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AubeEtMarnePotlid1250t850.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-501" title="Vase-top in the form of horns." src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AubeEtMarnePotlid1250t850-300x296.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="296" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Aube-et-Marne, 1250-850 bce</p></div>
<p>Some of these crescents are marked with chevrons and other symbols, as in the examples above, and below:</p>
<div id="attachment_502" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Mondhoerner.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-502" title="Mondhoerner" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Mondhoerner-300x215.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="215" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mondhörner, Switzerland</p></div>
<p>The Moonhorn at left, above, especially calls our attention because of its resemblance to another group of ancient crescents, this time in northwestern Europe. The lunulae of Ireland and Britain are incised with very similar patterns: fine zigzag borders, vertically marked-off fields filled with chevrons, and empty spaces. The one below is from an unidentified site in Ireland.</p>
<div id="attachment_504" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Lunular.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-504" title="Lunular" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Lunular-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lunula, bronze age Ireland</p></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s another, below, from Blessington, County Wicklow; the overexposure of the photo makes it hard to see, but it too has the chevron patterns along the &#8220;horns.&#8221; This Blessington lunula is dated to 2200 bce. (I&#8217;ve seen dates closer  to 1500 for others.) They may have been produced over many centuries. Were they ritual regalia or aristocratic bling?</p>
<div id="attachment_505" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/BlessingtonWicklow.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-505" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/BlessingtonWicklow-300x243.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="243" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blessington, Co. Wicklow, Eire</p></div>
<p>Some of them were found by peat-diggers in the Irish bogs.</p>
<div id="attachment_506" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 307px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Llanllyfni.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-506" title="Llanllyfni" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Llanllyfni-297x300.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Llanllyfni, Wales, Britain</p></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s a beautiful example from Wales. The patterns etched into the gold are so fine they are hard to see, but still the zigs and chevrons.</p>
<p>But what do these earlier lunulae, clearly meant to be worn, have to do with the clay Moonhorns of the continent? I don&#8217;t know, except for the evocation of the lunar crescent. But the symbolism has an even broader reach, going much further back in time on the western edge of Europe, in Portugal. Here it dates to the late neolithic, around or after 3200 bce.</p>
<div id="attachment_508" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 152px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Almendres56C.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-508 " title="Almendres56C" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Almendres56C-142x300.jpg" alt="" width="142" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Statue-menhir with lunula, Almendres Stone Circle</p></div>
<p>The stone circles of south-central Portugal include statue-menhirs (monoliths carved with human attributes) that are wearing lunulae on their chests. At right, one of the rough reliefs on a statue-menhir at Almendres. Two other stone circles in the same region, at Mogos and Vale Maria dos Meios, have similar statues with crescent breastplates. (The necklaces at the latter site are more deeply U-shaped than crescent, and curl up at the ends.) Some of the menhirs are breasted, others not, and often they show belts or other faint ornaments. Some of the monoliths hold crooks, or rather, because no arms are shown, these are placed against their chests. Schist crooks of the type shown have been found in Portuguese dolmens, some of them very finely incised with triangles, chevrons, and zigzags. They also appear on pottery pieces.</p>
<p>But it gets better. Actual examples exist of the lunulae worn by the ancient neolithic people who raised these stone circles. Excavations in the area around Lisbon have turned up limestone lunulas incised with lines similar to those on the (much younger) Moonhorns in Switzerland.</p>
<div id="attachment_509" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 135px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/LisbonPenlunulascalcaires.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-509 " title="LisbonPenlunulascalcaires" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/LisbonPenlunulascalcaires-125x300.jpg" alt="" width="125" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Limestone lunulae, Lisbon peninsula</p></div>
<p>Here are drawings (no photos located yet) of the neolithic limestone lunulae of the Lisbon peninsular. This symbolism persists, or rather recurs.</p>
<p>In a much later period &#8212; long after the neolithic, long after the bronze age lunulae of Ireland and Britain (Scotland has at least one too), and even after the clay Moonhorns of Switzerland, metal lunulas show up in Portugal.</p>
<p>Here are several from the southern Alentejo region (no date given, possibly in the Celt-Iberian, or more appropriately, the Lusitanian era):</p>
<div id="attachment_510" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 298px"><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/baleizaoalentejo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-510" title="baleizaoalentejo" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/baleizaoalentejo-288x300.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Torque-like lunulae from Baleizao, Alentejo, Portugal</p></div>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s another (probably later) lunula in silver, with various symbols, animals, knotwork, and possibly breasts or eyes, and serpent torc finials. What is the story behind this lunula? This whole post is about questions, not conclusions. But the recurrence of this theme is fascinating.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Nornsweaving.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-492" title="Norns" src="http://www.sourcememory.net/veleda/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Nornsweaving-300x252.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="252" /></a>I had no plans to attend Z Budapest’s ritual on Sunday night. I thought about going to Rabbit’s ceremony, but what I really wanted, after a week of hard work, was to kick back in the hotel room and watch Downton Abbey. (A somewhat guilty pleasure, my class loyalties and politics being what they are.) Alas, the Fates ordained otherwise.</p>
<p>When I heard about the protest (as it was first told to me) / silent meditation that Thorn had called for outside of Z’s ritual, I realized that I would have to be present to hold space. I was acutely conscious of the larger context of the sit-in: the ongoing campaign to ban all Dianic lineages whose rites were for women born and raised, and the vitriolic outpouring that happened to Yeshe Rabbit last year. I was concerned that things could go that way, again, and affect a lot of women—for starters, anyone who wanted to attend Z’s ritual, and ultimately a much larger community of Dianics.</p>
<p>The issue paramount in my mind, and forgotten amidst all the righteous rhetoric, was the sovereignty of women, our right to set our own boundaries and to decide who are our peers and allies. (Yes, of course   trans women too.) Women, that most divided of all groups, make different choices based on who we trust as allies. How can forcing boundaries of self-determination earn that trust? especially when breaking down women’s boundaries is and remains a historically enforced imperative. I was aware that honorably taking responsibility would make me a target; that many people would make unwarranted assumptions, in the gossip and aspersions that run wild out on the wire. But I would have to leave them to it.</p>
<p>The rights to self-determination and to resist coercion do not necessarily entail challenging someone else&#8217;s gender identification or the existence of multiple genders. (I am not going to address this very big subject, on which opinions differ even among queer theorists, here.) My own posts have moved about who is and can be an ally. My core criterion is caring deeply about women&#8217;s liberation. I will not stand for silencing or coercion of women, and I&#8217;ve seen a lot of that in these recent backlash decades. I am looking to broaden my alliances, but will not back down on these principles.</p>
<p>Passing by the restaurant at the Con, I saw Z and Glenn talking, and immediately knew why. So I horned in on the conversation. I told Z I would come to hold sacred space at the door to the ritual. I know that Thorn intended to create sacred space herself and was doing what she thought was right, by her lights. I respect her even when I don’t agree with her. We have common mystic ground. We haven’t had a chance to dialog about these issues, though I came to hear what she had to say at the Gender and Paganism conference last fall.</p>
<p>I had a sinking feeling just thinking about the radioactive zone of pre-judgment, assumptions, polarization, and frenzied name-calling that surrounds this issue. However, that couldn’t be helped. There were things that had to be faced, and said, and lived out. I heard that the controversy would be discussed at the Pagans and the Media panel, and attended it. Some very good things were said, others that I disagreed with or that were, frankly, irrelevant. There was a certain amount of circling around the issue, with one exception: Z was called out by name, in a way I have never seen done to anyone in all the years I have been coming to Pantheacon, in her absence. I could not remember or imagine a male elder coming close to being verbally targeted in this way, for anything. It&#8217;s not that an elder can never be wrong, but this breached the pan-tradition protocol of respecting face for elders. It would be far, far surpassed by what transpired later online.</p>
<p>Several years ago, when I heard an archdruid at the Con ridicule “matriarchalist fantasies” as having no historical basis whatsoever, even as he asserted the total non-sexism of his own tradition, no one said a peep. Some people laughed knowingly at the gibe. Sexist generalizations, no prob! I knew, too, how unlikely it was that anyone would challenge the fellow sitting two rows in front of me during the Media panel. He sported a leather jacket emblazoned with a woman tightly gagged and bound, and running along the border of chains, the inscription, “Bound to Please.” Though I find this symbolism of male dominance deeply offensive, I didn’t say anything to him. Nor was I going to bother people who went to bondage-themed parties or rituals glorifying “sacred prostitution,” or which banned women on their bloods, or honored gods linked to male dominance mythologies.</p>
<p>Pantheacon is a libertarian space, and so has places and scenes where I am a complete outsider (something I have a lot of practice at). At times I feel completely alienated, like the year our booth was next to the corset shop, which was mobbed by women forking over hundreds each for this constrictive garment. (The vendor moaned with relief when she took hers off at day&#8217;s end). Many people have this experience of alienation, for a whole variety of reasons, and not just at this conference. However, I feel that the people who run the Con (and thank you to the many volunteers) do a marvelous job holding the space for everyone, the whole disparate lot of us. Herding cats! The theme Unity in Diversity was an attempt to address the dissension and polarization.</p>
<p>During the question period of the panel, I spoke about what it means to deride female sovereignty in the context of the intense anti-feminist backlash we are living through now. Margot Adler had mentioned the shrinkage of feminist spaces, bookstores and Women’s Studies. I talked about how that had affected my work, as women’s history got thrown overboard in the stampede to Gender Studies. It&#8217;s not because women&#8217;s oppression has been solved! I said that this debate has got to get unstuck off the “essentialism” refrain. As long as the issue keeps getting cast only as biological determinism (and I see people in both camps insisting on this discourse in different ways) other real concerns are not being addressed, even effectively denied or misrepresented. We need to have a deeper conversation about the complexities, the differences and the commonalities, between cis, trans, and those who don&#8217;t fit this <em>new</em> gender binary. In the current climate such a dialogue, multilogue actually, seems impossible. May the time come soon when we can do so without it turning into a destructive beatdown.</p>
<p>It is hurtful to call people “transies,” but what about “bigot”? This word has been hurled in a steady stream since the 80s, and is in full cry in the current dispute. It is itself used in bigoted ways, especially against lesbian feminists, radical feminists and butch lesbians, who are routinely denounced. Doctrinal certainty cuts more than one way. Last year, Rabbit came to my booth in distress. She didn’t say what had actually gone down, and neither did Amethyst, who came by equally upset for opposite reasons. Only later did I hear about the confrontation at Rabbit’s ritual. I read through the ugliness on the blogs, and was horrified to see what they said about her, the curtain of contempt that descended. Someone even felt entitled to make death threats. This year, people on both sides say they feel that they are unwelcome at the Con, unsafe attending a ritual, or unsafe because they are not allowed to attend that same ritual. Ironically, people who sat in outside the Dianic ritual chose to do so rather than to attend a trans-inclusive Dianic event in the very same timeslot, a much better-attended event.</p>
<p>Coercion and derision is not the way to change someone’s mind, and projecting mistaken assumptions from what one person says or does to entire groups is guaranteed to harden lines. I was well aware that sticking my neck out on this issue would, for many, conflate me completely with what others said or did, regardless of what where I actually stood. It would not matter a whit to them that my events are open to everybody. A lot of things would not matter in the heat of this destructive, vicious argument.</p>
<p>Last weekend, it looked increasingly likely to me that historic lineages of Dianics could get drummed out of Pantheacon, and all in the name of love and justice. (I felt reassured on this score after hearing from the founding elder, Glenn Turner.) Many of the Amazon priestesses were not at the Con this year, such as Ruth Barrett, Ma ShiAat Oloya, Leilani Birely, Falcon River, Anniitra Ravenmoon, Letecia Layson, Wendy Griffin. I can’t speak for them or where they might stand. My concern was to uphold their right to space at the Pantheacon.</p>
<p>So Nava and I decided to weard the door at Z’s ritual: to be there in sacred space, while chanting the Names of Goddess. Perhaps our devotion would touch that of Thorn and others who were meditating. We knew that Glenn would be there too, and were thankful for her holding the space. I knew that Thorn didn’t intend harm with her silent meditation, even if she had made her intention to pressure clear. Still the polarization was daunting. The coercive aspects of the ongoing Urania / Pluto square were on my mind.</p>
<p>We came early to settle in next to the door, me on the floor. I wrapped my Raven mantle around my hips in case it got chilly. Then I began to chant the Sri Lalita Sahasranama. This is one of the Thousand Names of Devi litanies from India, invoking the divine qualities that are within all of us. Nava was meditating and praying too, and Glenn sat beside her, and a while later, Bobbie sat down. Thalassa was there, though I didn’t see her at the time. Elders of various vintages were in the house.</p>
<p>My eyes were closed most of the time, so I missed seeing much of what was going on. I could tell that people were lining up to enter the ritual to my right—door still closed—and facing them were the silent protesters. (Although Thorn didn’t use this word, many did and still do.) I found out afterward that many of these women felt like they were walking a gauntlet as they came down the hall. This feeling only  intensified when some of the protesters took pictures of them. (There is no other word for that but intimidation.) I caught a whiff of disagreement between staff and Bobbie, when they told her not to film what was going on. Some attendees later said no one had stopped protesters from taking pictures of them.</p>
<p>I kept chanting the invocations: Compassionate Devi. Blessed Wisdom. Supreme Power. Origin.  Thousand Petaled Lotus Pouring Forth a Stream of Divine Essence, Foreknower in Perfection, Remover of Obstacles, Dispeller of Fear, Dweller in the Heart. Mother of Ten Million Universes, Shining Embodiment. Wish-fulfilling Vine, Remover of Bondage from the Bound. Immeasurable. Bliss of Truth. Mother. Liberator. Peacefulness.</p>
<p>At one point I felt more people arriving. Rabbit had brought people from her ritual to hold space between the two groups. They sang We All Come From the Goddess, and we sang it along with them. They alternated it with another beautiful chant of Thorn’s. Women inside were also singing We All Come From the Goddess. Z came out and spoke. She apologized for hurting anyone, and she upheld her right to perform her rites. I couldn’t see any response, except when Rabbit admonished Z for forthrightly addressing “your side.” She told her, “There are no sides,” which sounded cosmic and everything, but unconvincing under the circumstances. We weren’t in Rumi’s field yet, where there is no judgment, no rebuke. People came to “take a stand” and there was no mistaking the opposition.</p>
<p>I can’t remember what Z said, but here is her written statement: “I know you are here for me. I come out to say something to all of you. I am sorry if I have hurt anyone’s feelings.  I apologize. I stand for your right of sacred space for the trans community. I stand with my life’s work for the women to have the right to their sacred space equally. I have supported PantheaCon goals for unity and diversity for the 18 years this conference has existed and an opportunity to have everyone to express themselves in a safe place. Peace.” This apology, as difficult as it was for a proud Hungarian priestess to make, has barely been acknowledged in the blogosphere rants, or it has been rejected, for the most part, because she did not back down on the parameters of her rituals.</p>
<p>The silent meditators continued on. Z went back in and the ritual began. I resumed chanting the Sahasranama of Devi. After some time, the silent people wrapped up their meditation and dispersed. I continued chanting for a while longer. Then Glenn, Nava, Bobbie and I talked, a good, long conversation. I felt relieved, for the moment, but less so when the ritual participants came out and talked about having to pass through hostile terrain. I later found out that some even thought that we by the door were there to protest too, adding to their feeling of isolation and outcast. On the other side of the hall, I heard later, certain protesters had said angry words to Rabbit and Devin, assuming that they were on the “wrong” side.</p>
<p>It was truly the cusp of a stellium in Pisces, with a new moon (and therefore sun, plus Mercury and Chiron) joining Neptune, fresh after its entry into its own oceanic sign. Confusion, illusion, and smoking mirrors; also the fragrance of devotion and love, the potential for inspirational vision, and perhaps, in time, the dissolution of acrimony into ho&#8217;oponopono. We are all being ground on the anvil of Urania squaring Kali, with many more passes to go. The larger perspective on this tempest will make itself felt in time.</p>
<p>We came home exhausted, after loading and packing up the booth, then unloading after the drive. We had sold little more than half of what we did last year, and were wrung out. Then I saw the firestorm of denunciations on the blogosphere, once again. The comments section on The Wild Hunt was inhabited by torrents of rage and outrage. Bigot, bigot, and bigot to the tenth power. Accusations of man-hating were repeated, in various iterations. Curses uttered, even. My womb was hurting, no lie.</p>
<p>One blogger purported to give a dispassionate account of what went down at the protest. Sitting by the door, he wrote, were “three cis-gender crones,” one of whom was rocking and “muttering.” Ah, the muttering of crones, that phrase really takes me back. I recognize the meme of an old woman singing Goddess invocations, interpreted as muttering some incomprehensible spell, questionable and perhaps diabolic. So now I was seen as a muttering cis-gender crone. But I had plenty of new identities to choose from, if I cared to, in the online vilification stream.</p>
<p>Bigots, manhaters, transphobes, and bigots again, were being cast into outer darkness. The rightful recipients of love and understanding and solidarity and sympathy were clearly marked out. The Others who must be expelled were radical feminists, and if Pantheacon continued to harbor them, it must be boycotted. One man outright called Z “evil.” Women piled on too. Stones were flying in the cyber village square, in the name of tolerance and acceptance. Every time I look again I am heartsick.</p>
<p>A few brave souls waded in to defend against the pan-defamation. (Thank you.) On another blog, a woman begged for forgiveness for really, really needing to attend that ritual, because of the sexual violence and abuse she had suffered: “Instead of taking part in a ritual which I needed I’m sitting in a hotel room writing this letter. I didn’t attend the Sacred Body ritual hosted by Z Budapest because I couldn’t face the protest. A protest sparked by pain. I know pain. I was sexually abused in my marriage for 17 years.  Then I was abused for 5 more years by different men. I hated my womanhood and my body.  Rituals like the one offered by Zsuzsanna have helped me begin to heal and I need them. I’m not a bigot.  I don’t hate you. Please, sisters, hear my words.” Some people relented a bit, but others were sternly implacable. One man tried to invalidate her concerns by a comparison to racism. (Dood! it’s not for you to pass judgment on any woman, least of all one who has suffered beyond your understanding.) http://pncminnesota.wordpress.com/2012/02/20/letter-to-the-editor-ciswomen-only-ritual-at-pantheacon/</p>
<p>Some people have chosen to forget, if they ever recognized it, the long history of bludgeoning women into submission, of public humiliation and denunciation, ritually repeated. This is not the dialog that needs to happen; it is no dialog at all. Thankfully, I am seeing a breeze of reasonableness come through on some blogs, like that of Gus diZerega, who I just met at the Con. He spoke about the importance of harmony among participants for a ritual to work, and said of Z’s ritual:</p>
<p>“She and those who attended did not make a statement about how the larger community should conduct their rituals let alone setting their ritual up as a proper guide for all, or for all women. Quite explicitly otherwise. In the context of Pantheacon this was a ritual for people wanting to attend a ritual with particular parameters. Those desires were legitimate and indeed are present in almost every Pagan society. (I say “almost” because perhaps somewhere there is an exception, but I doubt it.)” Read more: http://blog.beliefnet.com/apagansblog/2012/02/pantheacon-2012-politics-and-the-controversy-over-womens-rituals.html#ixzz1nTnSL37I</p>
<p>Something strange: the comments link on Rabbit’s blog post about this controversy comes up blank, and so does Devin Hunter’s entire blog post. I have heard that other posts describe the experience of women who attended the ritual, but am just now finding links to them. Some I can’t post because they are restricted to the person’s Facebook friends. This one comes from the HecateDemeter blog (Undermining the Patriarchy Every Chance I Get. And I Get a Lot of Chances.) It’s called, I Contain Multitudes:</p>
<p>“What I want is a Paganism full of diversity. I want to honor and respect those who draw a circle that includes me and those who draw a circle that says, ‘We need to be inside here for a time. That means that we need you to stand outside. Can you please stand here and guard our door?’ We need rituals that are drawn as tightly as needed to guard the sanctity of those who have been othered and excluded. Of those who need to other and exclude themselves in order to preserve their own sacred and diverse identities. Of those who simply want to draw a circle and stand inside it without being attacked.” http://hecatedemeter.wordpress.com/2012/02/19/i-contain-multitudes/</p>

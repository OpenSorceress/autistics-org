		<description><![CDATA[Yes, you&#039;re right about the distorted picture from literature alone. I read from many sources on Chinese history about the countless editing of texts from Confucians and Imperial bureaucrats alike, as well as different periods of book-burnings for whatever political or propaganda reasons. It&#039;s because of this that when it comes to ancient Chinese history, the folk orature seems far more reliable than the literature.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On development of oracle bone script and neolithic pottery predecessors of same, I&#039;m now reading Sarah Nelson&#039;s Shamanism and the Origins of States, which goes into current scholarship on this, several pp of summary. You might want to take a look at it. 
Yes, you&#039;re right about the extensive revisions to masculinize the culture heros (Nu Wa still gets credit for inventing music however). These were multiple and go back and back in time. The Confucians had their way with the lit, the Zhou rulers having already altered and bureaucratized the way wu ceremonies were carried out, and the Chin emperor destroyed as much of the old records as he could get at (missed the tombs).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you Max. The Taoist religion despite male dominant and elite influences still preserve at its core spiritually enlightening teachings descended from the shamanic tradition. I have only heard of the work &#039;Understanding Reality&#039; and it sounds just as interesting as &#039;The Inner Teachings of Taosim&#039; which I&#039;m longing to read.  I also have noticed the shamanic foundation of early dynasties as well as the high status of women in these dynasties. In fact, I&#039;m really interested in the theory that Chinese writing itself developed from the jiǎgǔwén or oracle bone scripts of the Wu.  Even earlier evidence of pictographic characters come from pottery and jade ornaments likely produced by women. I can&#039;t help but notice later legends or stories that tend to steal credit away from women and give it to men like the legend that Chinese writing was invented by a man named Cangjie who was bureaucrat of the lengendary Yellow Emperor Huangdi. Ironically it is said Cangjie was inspired by the veins of a tortoise which was the animal whose shell was used in divination by the Wu.  Many other important sciences and forms knowledge are attributed to males but originally came from women, like agriculture and herbology which are credited to the king Shennong and cooking which is credited to Fu Xi. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the Bagua or 8 trigrams of Taoist cosmology originally came from Fu Xi&#039;s sister Nu Wa who founded the Yin-Yang symbol or rather more realistically the Wu themselves.

To Millennium Twain as well as Max, the use of tones and sounds like bells and drums are indeed a deep part of the shamanic heritage and they remind me of the cosmogony described in the Korean Budoji where the great goddess Mago herself was born from a primeval &quot;music&quot; as it was described. This sounds somewhat similar to the Hindu concept of Om or the sound of creation. Music was viewed as a very important symbol of the cosmos itself and dance reflected it in the body.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I consider Taoism to have conserved the old ways to a much greater degree than the religion of any other patriarchal society. Have you seen the translations of classics like Understanding Reality? some very profound teachings in there. 
The early dynasties had a shamanic foundation but cannibalized it (to borrow Jack Forbes&#039; phrase) to a great degree, with high levels of human sacrifice for example. However i think we have to look to what people did outside the state structures, where these ways persisted much longer, and even to present times in the Shen Jiao that David has pointed up. 
The use of tone is certainly a big part of the picture for ancient Chinese, who had sounding stones and bronze gongs and bells and jade chimes, some of which show up in scenes of the Wu ceremonies on Warring States period bronzes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[NiHao David, Max!
hadn&#039;t heard about the ShenJiao before, google searching now.
and, yes, all the Daoists and Daoism that I have seen were a patriarchal construct to destroy the wisdom, the knowledge of the personalities and powers, of all our relations -- the TRUE focus of harmony (quite distinct from the &#039;harmonies&#039; of conforming to the city-state!)
if you can suggest any keywords, cultural phrases, including the Chinese characters, for taking the wisdom back a few thousand more years, from say 3,100BC to 24,000 BC -- to help me get a handle for sharing the ancient Matriculture of Song, Ceremony, Moon, Star, Planet and Spirit.
a few phrases/subjects which today I am following up, to try and take me back a step or two further into Chinese/Korean/Japanese oral, sung, sculptured Music-Herstory are &quot;Bird Prophecy&quot;, Yin-Yang Magic, and the Five Planets ... i.e., I am looking to the era of greater consciousness, of the song ritual economy that preceded the destructive Taoist and Buddhist, etc. ... when &#039;directionology&#039; was not about a contrived &#039;metric&#039; of the relationships of priests and warlords cementing their ownership of the rivers, mountains, commerce, music and stars ... but rather the direction and timing of the Wu-people&#039;s relationship with the rivers and forests, plants and animals, herbs and flowers, stars and planets, the VAST light and shadow world-spirit-scape of sun and moon and all our relationsions, neighboring clans and their cultural animal-totems and sky-constellation deities, music-scales, tribal-colours, foods, artistry, musical instruments, gifts ...
I do find it instructive that city-state period was built upon a musical foundation where each change of sovereign was accompanied by a selection of a new fundmental note of the pentatonic scale of (the birds? and) the planets, from which the associated four (and later seven, twelve) were constructed by using the ratios 2/3 and 4/3 etc. to create the new scales, to which everyone in the &#039;kingdom&#039; then had to tune to.
from this I deduce that the earlier Wu-matriculture had a musical-magic-economy based on unique scales, bird/animal sounds, tribal songs for each clan -- to sing the songline of their particular territories, landscapes, spirit-worlds -- a spirit-economy which would/must be shared with adjacent song-spirit-cultures in order to journey and harmonize there.
these thoughts then suggest to me that I need to find the old Chinese and Korean words which are equivalent to the words &#039;Kami&#039; 神 in Japan, the &#039;Kamuy&#039; カムイ of the Ainu (the Spirits, Personalities); and the Songline, the Dreaming of the Aboriginal Australians.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the sources.  Yes, I forgot to mention how Shenjiao basically focuses on achieving harmony with one&#039;s self and with nature or one&#039;s surroundings. The shamans were the spirtual leaders or adepts who communicated with shen such as ancestors or gods and discerned their will upon the people. I understand that Taoism at its most basic tenants is no different with its focus on nature, balance, and harmony etc., but then you have the later beliefs that a living entity whether animal or human could use the force of the Tao to achieve greater power and states of being. I notice that this is contradictory with basic Taoist notions of moderation and humility.  And in my research I have notice a masculinization of the pantheon where many deities that were once female became male, especially celestial divinities. This is why I am so glad we have scholars like you who can shed much light on the histories of these religions and cultures that is hard to find in mainstream sources.]]></description>

I remember that Gudrun was active in the first half of the 90&#039;s with her camera picturing Kunama rituals and costumes, when I was in the western lowlands. I would like to see her film and make my comments. Let me know about. I&#039;m about to publish a book on Kunama during the Italian period using my knowledge on Kunama kotokona (uses) from my field research (matrilineal kinship and Italian colonial rule, possession/andinne, witchcraft etc..)]]></description>

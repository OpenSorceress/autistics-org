		<description><![CDATA[No, not “oppositional sexism.” I’m talking about the pervasiveness of male supremacy, and the way men police and enforce conformity on women, of any stripe. I&#039;m calling attention to the fact that a butch lesbian is indistinguishable to a stranger from a trans man. The attacker doesn’t know the difference, doesn’t care; all he knows is that this person does not “fit” and therefore equals a target. In either case the reason for the attack is that the person does not fit the decreed gender norms, whatever their internal identification may be. 

This analogy is spurious: &quot;a man might still beat up or kill another man. You can’t say &#039;oh. where is male privilege now?&#039; 
I wouldn’t. Men do that every day, doesn&#039;t take a drop away from patriarchy, it&#039;s part of that system. Male privilege is not distributed equally, but a matter of degree, determined in racialized and gendered and classed terms. That is part of how the system of male dominance works. Men rape and oppress other men, typically in gendered ways. Those perceived as less masculine are subject to violence, verbal abuse (particularly name-calling like “pussy,” “faggot,” etc.) and subordination. Conquering men treat men of conquered peoples as feminized, because to be oppressed is to be like a woman. Feminization is a foundation of subordination on a global scale. This is also the basis of homophobic violence, including rape, and in many cultures, men who penetrate other men are classified as straight while those who are penetrated, dismissed as gay or trans. So the male privilege of a gay man is relative ... to other men. Not to women.

&quot;The only parties involved are cisgendered people.&quot; 
When a dyke is attacked by a man, being “cis” doesn’t enter into it. It is her resistance to patriarchal codes of gender, to the prescribed norms of femininity, that makes her a target. As a woman, she is a target to begin with; this is just an enhancement of an already oppressed status. The pattern of oppression here is clear-cut. You don’t see her stalking or attacking him, because the axis of oppression is male violence against gender-variant (or resistant) women, women who look or act &quot;like men.&quot; Or men who look/act &quot;like women,&quot; or trans people who plain don&#039;t fit what they are &quot;supposed to&quot; be. 

You are treating dykes as somehow like men who get attacked by other men, because of a notion that their not identifying as men (that is, as trans men) makes them &quot;cis&quot; and therefore in the category of oppressors. If they identified as trans, that would put them in the category of oppressed, according to you. But since they don&#039;t identify as men (trans men), then you define the dykes as analogous to (cis) men. The real parallel is that straight men attack trans people, and lesbians, and gay men, and sometimes bis, because they are threatened by any divergence from the set codes of sex and gender. 

Lesbians are not analogous to men, cis or straight or gay or trans, nor is the violence against us, most recently that horrific attack in Lincoln Nebraska, and the shootings in Texas, random. It is targeted, with a multiplier effect: the violence against women; against lesbians; against gender-non-conformity, and against feminist defiance as well. The violence against trans women and men is also targeted, for transgressing in their own ways the code that says, “women are one specific way and men are another and no person should blur or transgress these boundaries.” There are lots of differences between all these groups, but this is one area we ought to be able to agree on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cis privilege is the privilege that a cis person has over a trans person. What you are thinking about is oppositional sexism. This is what says &quot;women are one specific way and men are another and no person should blur or transgress these boundaries.&quot;

There is definitely male privilege. However, a man might still beat up or kill another man. You can&#039;t say &quot;oh. where is male privilege now?&quot; You can&#039;t say it doesn&#039;t exists. The same goes for this situation. The only parties involved are cisgendered people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hail to the muttering Crones! I know that in the culture of Aloha in Hawai&#039;i we
know that many schools hold the knowledge. There is no one right way but many. I feel that there is enough space for all types of ceremonies and rituals to exist. We are all children of the rainbow respecting each others right to gaher in the way we feel safe and that fills out souls. May we feel Her loving arms around us holding us together at all times, even when  there are times we go to do our secret mysteries. Isn&#039;t it all still held in love and Aloha? Let the magick rise up and teach us in the face of challenges that being human can pose. Blessed be and Aloha.]]></description>

I&#039;ve already said that i&#039;m not here to defend Z&#039;s choice of words, but you are forgetting, if in fact you knew, that the campaign to ban Dianic rituals such as this predates her remarks. This is the larger issue, and in fact that campaign has succeeded. Pantheacon has changed policy so that these rituals cannot be featured as workshops, only in private suites.

		<description><![CDATA[It wasn&#039;t that she wanted to hold a ritual for women who had menstruated.  It&#039;s that she said &quot;all women&quot;, and then proceeded to define people out of womanhood.  Just like saying &quot;all people&quot; and then defining people out of it based on some random criteria, like having red hair.

If I held a ritual for women who had hysterectomies, I wouldn&#039;t say it was open to &quot;all women&quot; then call out only a specific type of women, I say &quot;for women (set A) who have had hysterectomies (subset B)&quot;. This does not negate the woman hood of women who haven&#039;t had hysterectomies, but it says &quot;this is for a specific subset of women based on physical experiences&quot;.  The same could be said for a ritual of healing for women who had been raped, support for women who had borne children, or celebration of cronehood (eg women over 50.)

The difference is subtle, but crucial: You can design an exclusive space without negating those who are excluded.  

This is where Z and all of her defenders fail: They can&#039;t just say &quot;women who have menstruated&quot; (a subset - some women due to health issues never menstruate.)  They have to prattle on about &quot;all women&quot; and &quot;those who weren&#039;t &#039;born&#039; women aren&#039;t really women&quot;.  This is where and how the bigotry shows its ugly head.

The fact is, the radical dianics are talking just like the evangelicals do when they talk about gay marriage - just as strident, acusatory and hate filled.

BTW, I&#039;m cis, bi, butch, nulliparous, disabled and have had a hist.  Lots of women don&#039;t have all these things in common with me.  I don&#039;t try to deny their womanhood, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Originally I started out thinking that Thorn&#039;s protest, and her supporters, were probably in the right. Since then I have changed my mind completely. I think it is very important for people to have rituals for women-born-women only, just as I think that it is important for people to have rituals for women-born-men, or men-born-women, or Celtic traditionalists only, or any other group who wants or needs time to themselves, for themselves. If we banish one we can end up banishing another, and another, until there&#039;s nobody left except a bunch of people walking on eggs, phrasing everything as innocuously as possible, doing their best not to offend anyone at the expense of their own souls. That would be a kind of passive-aggressive hell. 

I agree with Z Budapest on very little, but my arguments with her go by the board in my defense of the right of people to gather. In the OTO, one of the primary beliefs is in the defense of &quot;light, life, love and liberty.&quot; If someone wants to have a women-born-women ritual, they have that absolute right. If you don&#039;t want to go, then don&#039;t go. I don&#039;t go where I&#039;m not welcome. Instead, I go where I am welcome. I don&#039;t go marching into a Baptist church and demand that they acknowledge the Goddess. Likewise, I am not going to go to a women-born-women ritual and demand that they accept me, or anyone else. It&#039;s possible to respect each other&#039;s spaces and boundaries, and it&#039;s possible for us to disagree civilly.

So often, pagans are afraid to disagree. They do not want anyone to disagree or to dislike anyone else. No one is required to accept me, as I am not required to accept anyone. Anyone has the perfect freedom to dislike me intensely, and I have the right to dislike them as well. And I will defend their right to dislike me and to exclude me. That is part of personal liberty. I defend the right for people to separate from one another and make distinctions. And doing that is a hell of a long way from &quot;bigotry.&quot; Exclusion does not automatically equal discrimination. There are shades of gray here that are being deliberately overlooked. 

I want us all to get along. But I don&#039;t believe that it&#039;s necessary for all of us to do everything together all the time. That&#039;s one of the basic &quot;geek fallacies.&quot; 

Thanks for hearing me out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you. I&#039;m sick of this controversy, and even sicker of being jumped on by friends/acquaintances for questioning the right of anyone to exclude trans-women. 

Hilariously, many of the trans women involved are acting very much like other people raised as males in this context - basically monopolizing conversations in a manner reminiscent of the way that boys of my generation drowned out girls in high school, so that to truly participate in academics a girl needed to either be very strong willed or attend an all female school. (I was blessed with Asperger&#039;s syndrome, so didn&#039;t notice/succumb to the pressure to shut up and listen to those (males) who had more &quot;right&quot; to participate/talk. Most other female bodied individuals learned their &quot;place&quot;.)]]></description>

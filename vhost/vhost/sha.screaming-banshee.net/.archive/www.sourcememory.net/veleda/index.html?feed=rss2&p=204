		<description><![CDATA[Wow. This article you wrote Max, gets down to the real gritty.  When I and countless others learn about history, we NEVER hear or read about this stuff-- that is an in depth look at patriarchy and domination among world and especially Western cultures.  Sure, we read about kings, dynasties, and empires and even some of the awful things they&#039;ve committed but never about the roots of these things or their implications during that time let alone how they affect us in this day and age.  I am in awe and at the same time upset why I never learned all this before!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All people have this potential. Sadly we know much less than we could have about Bernedette&#039;s visions because of Church interference (they locked her away in a convent where she was not allowed to speak about her experiences to her peers, only to high clergy and high society visitors who kept asking all the wrong questions, over and over. (Color of the Lady&#039;s shoes, and other details that missed the essence of her experience.) Her very low social position as a poor woman gave her few alternatives, but you have to wonder what she would have manifested if she had become the guardian priestess of the Lourdes grotto, as her ancient ancestors might have done. In any case, her vision and devotion was to the Female Divine, as with so many other mystics including Ramakrishna.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One day a more indept study of Bernadette and her super concious visions will come to light.  Many think that she was singlely graced by God and she was a diamond soul and very advanced being.  The wonderful fact is we too can commune with the Divine/.  St. Francis saw Jesus in vision every night and cured the sick and raised the dead even though he was beset with many ailments.  There are many others and many not known to the world but to God alone.  Ramakrishna a great saint of India would daily go into ecstatic samadhi or God Communion.

		<description><![CDATA[Definitely many seers were persecuted as heretics. Bernadette herself faced strong skepticism from churchmen; that she was able to break through is testimony to the power of her vision. There must have been others in the centuries before who sank under the weight of repression.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is fascinating Max. I&#039;ve also found Bernadette&#039;s story absorbing and have often wondered how to &#039;retrieve&#039; the shamanic or visionary experiences of women in Catholic tradition from the patriarchal and dogmatic trappings that framed their reception. Teresa of Avila is another woman who moved between the Carmelite and marrano (forced Jewish convert) traditions and family matriarchies. And perhaps some other seer heritage defined as heresy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You will be able to see Woman Shaman, since it is a dvd that will ship to Europe, and quite affordable. Some clips will be viewable online as well. I agree that the technology rests on some very distressing foundations, such as Apple&#039;s slavery-in-all-but-name factories in China. However, since the scientistic mechanistic worldview is a reaction to extremely destructive Christian dogma, i see them as connected, by contrast with Indigeous cosmovisions. Think of &quot;subdue the earth,&quot; and the continuities there in today&#039;s industrialized corporate feudalism. I see &quot;that beautiful image of God&quot; as part of the problem, because it was so thoroughly masculinized, hegemonic, and made separate from our consciousness and from the material world. Those schisms have to be overcome, in my view, and replaced with recognition of the interconnectedness of all things, &quot;All our relations&quot; as the Lakota say. A Christianity based in the Beatitudes would have been far less problematic, but as some have said, it turned into Paulinianity, with heavy infusions of Roman authoritarianism, which i personally can&#039;t relate to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read your essay on  Thrive , and have little chnace of seeing the film, as I live in Europe.While I agree with 99% of what you have written in the essay, I have a question about our current technology. First  I firmly  BELIEVE that our attitudes, our capacity to observe our world, and to feel part of it are a very potent antidote to the current spiritual crisis that is plaguing Western civilization. But as far as the technology is concerned, I now have doubts.It has evolved as an organic part of a belief system, a cosmogony which is propped AGAINST the traditional aspect of our Christian heritage (re Descartes). This tradition contained our greed, and exploitation of nature. The past 30 years have seen an unprecedented destruction of the containing effects of our religious tradition (I am not saying that our Christian tradition is all pie in the sky, far from it, but it had some definite advantages along with that depressing social control ).I am not sure at this time if our current technology is compatible with the new consciousness you are talking about. I have seen first hand the effects of this technology (computerization), outside of the much becried capitalistic setting, with the nice  good  employees, and the nasty EVIL bad bosses, and the bad news is that even outside the capitalistic setting, our technology definitely blights that  beautiful image of God that we were SUPPOSED TO BE, in the Jewish/Christian cosmogony.Care to comment ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not at all. You didn&#039;t read carefully enough to put aside your assumptions. How did you miss this: &quot;Counter to the modern market-driven shaman-fad, the shaman is chosen by the spirits, not self-selected. Initiation cannot be purchased, and boasting is a sure sign of pretense. Instead of self-indulgence and ego-boosting, the medicine woman puts in intensive effort, sacrifice, hardship, and suffering.&quot; 

However, all people have the potential to access these states of consciousness, and in many cultures there is a continuum, with participation by the community -- chanting, clapping, dancing -- in which the shamanic ritual creates a shared transformative experience. In some regions there may be only a few shamans, while in others, such as the San Ju/hoan &quot;Bushmen,&quot; a significant portion of the population may be considered in this light.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice. Written broadly enough to include anyone who thinks she is a shaman though with no training or experience. I&#039;m a shaman, you&#039;re a shaman, we&#039;re all shamans. So the designation means nothing at all.]]></description>

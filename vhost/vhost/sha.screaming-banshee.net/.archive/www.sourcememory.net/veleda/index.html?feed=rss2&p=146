		<description><![CDATA[Please don&#039;t think i am attacking the female Second Life users. Your example of the inflexibility of the prototypes is exactly what i&#039;m talking about. It forces women to adopt personas that don&#039;t express who they are, only a limited male fantasy. If there was real diversity i wouldn&#039;t care. But this is a potent distortionary force, and lots of people don&#039;t even notice it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just in defense of female SL users... I *tried* to make my avatar a bit more realistic and could not... the parameters on the normal female avatar wouldn&#039;t allow it.  I was able to get a bit better than the standard anorexic barbie doll, but not much.

And to be fair, there are very few realistic male avatars either - there&#039;s just as much beefcake as cheesecake out there.  Because it&#039;s a virtual environment, so people are playing out fantasies.  What is sad is that there&#039;s so little variety in their fantasies. 

(And I had just as much difficulty trying to get something close to a realistic shape out of the SIMS as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not about how much they have on. I would turn your term fanservice around, it is driven by manservice. For nerds included. Sure, there are females who follow the models set by men, because they were and are. Those artists may not have thought about it much; those are the norms they follow, full stop. As for all body types, i will be convinced when you can show me a significant proportion sized and proportioned the way most women are. Husky, fat, old, unpretty, the range, not sylphs who are big-breasted or not, anorexic or just slim, muscular as long as they have tiny waists and bazooms. The posing is part of what i find so limited and limiting. I don&#039;t believe it is intentional in many cases, but that&#039;s not the point. On the other hand, some of it is intentional with an edge that is unsavory. A few images, so what, but we are being inundated by this stuff.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t mean to come across as saying you were against nudity - just in several of your comments you say the women are scantily clad or lacking armor.

However, I don&#039;t think that this is a solely single gendered limitation (I DO think it is a dominated by males though). For instance - Clamp, a group of all female manga artists who primarily draw Manga for young girls and women (Shoujo) draw a large number of buxom barbie women but draw women of all ages and body types. For Instance Yuuko - a witch - http://tinyurl.com/yuukoexample. - is drawn as sultry and dark and is often featured posing.

On the other hand you have films like Suckerpunch  who director said this about fanservice - Zack Snyder: Do you not get the metaphor there? The girls are in a brothel performing for men in the dark. In the fantasy sequences, the men in the dark are us. The men in the dark are basically me; dorky sci-fi kids.

I do think a large portion of the art out their is about fan service  ( http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice) but I do not think all of its intentional. Bayonetta on the other hand is a different story.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are much mistaken if you think my objection is to nudity in art. I use it myself, and have extensively documented it in archaeology and cultural history. But the range here is far broader. 

 I don&#039;t disagree that it is what the artists think ideal, my point is that this is a mass pattern that reduces the female to a narrow, male-defined stereotype. Limiting and often insulting. 

I am challenging the tide of coy, simpering, playboy bunnyesque memes because of their omnipresence, their narrowness, their conformity, and their discontinuity with the vast cultural heritages we can draw on. I wouldn&#039;t give a flying if it was here and there, but this is the dominant cultural norm, and i will speak out against it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I disagree with you in part here. Gods and Goddesses have been bare or nude in artistic work for quite a while.  They represented what the artist thought ideal and still does. 

After looking at some of your imagery chosen some of them are cleary not meant to be goddesses - like morrigan from the dark stalkers video games. Others like the Japanese influenced art from anime and manna is pretty standard stuff and not all of the mature stuff is about rape. There are several literary tropes about breasts that comics/manga use such as Large breasts = combat prowess. 

A lot of these works are influenced by the Sword and Sorcery days of chain mail bikinis dating back from the 1920&#039;s up through the comic book age of the 1950&#039;s. 

The artistic styling really hasnt changed its just drawn better (imo), more vivid, and more available. 

Just because they don&#039;t represent the goddess/witch/shaman/Amazon to you doesn&#039;t make if bad art, just art you dont like.]]></description>

I too have felt this icky feeling, and working to integrate a more sacred view of femininity, sexuality and sensuality in my daily life and writings. It&#039;s a fine line to walk, as I&#039;m sure you know! In any case, really learning a lot from your articles, here and elsewhere. Best, T]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, it is distressing how many Pagan women accept this narrow spectrum of images the way that it is and was. Sexuality is great, but not this phony, plastic stuff, the patriarchal agenda as you say. There&#039;s so much more to female power. Yesterday, doing an image search in Russian for &quot;priestess,&quot; you wouldn&#039;t believe the amount of porn that came up. Meanwhile the spammers are coming after this blog because their webcrawlers find words that make them think this is somehow their market. Way, way off the mark, guys.]]></description>

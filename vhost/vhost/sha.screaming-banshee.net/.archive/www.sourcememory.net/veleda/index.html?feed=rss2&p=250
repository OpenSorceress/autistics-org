		<description><![CDATA[The Afro-asiatic influence on the development of Greek civilization from pre-Hellenic Aegean times to Archaic Hellenic times is so profoundly obvious, one can just take a quick survey of the archaeology of these periods to see it. You don&#039;t have to read the works of Martin Bernal like his &#039;Black Spark, White Fire&#039; to realize this. In fact, I don&#039;t know what is so controversial about his works or others like it.  I thought mainstream academia has long acknowledged such influece on the Greece and the Aegean. In fact here are two excellent sources I came across some years ago:

http://phoenicia.org/greek.html

http://theglitteringeye.com/?p=2757

Not only are there shared architectural themes with temples and shrines but even fundamental religious themes and beliefs like the coup d&#039;état of male deities by their sons, sacred pillars and stones, sacred groves, sacred serpents and snake cults, demi-god culture heroes some of whom Greek legends specifically say are foreign, and chthonic monsters, all explained in the first link. The second link shows Greek hymns having Mesopotamian features.

In fact it is wonder why ancient Greece is NEVER labeled or classified as a &#039;Near Eastern&#039; civilization but a European one yet Egypt IS despite its culture being entirely African!]]></description>

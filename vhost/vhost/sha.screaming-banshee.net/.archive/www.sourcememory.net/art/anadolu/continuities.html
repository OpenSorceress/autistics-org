      <p>Thousands of years later, the Anatolian goddess Kybele <br>
        is depicted on a throne flanked by lions (right, from Pergamon, Turkey) <br>

          Phoenicians brought this deity to southwestern Iberia. <br>
            She is an alabaster ritual vessel; when libation is poured into her, <br>
          the liquid shoots out from her breasts into the basin she holds.

      <p>After consulting the Sibylline oracle, Rome officially adopted veneration of<br>
       Kybele during the emergency of Hannibal's march through Italy. Her sacred <br>
      meteorite was brought from Asia Minor and installed in a Metro&ouml;n (&quot;mother<br>
      shrine&quot;) in Rome. In the Roman era the goddess was increasingly depicted<br>
      &quot;in a chariot drawn by lions,&quot; with the shamanic hand drum that had been her <br>
      symbol for centuries. Roman bronze.</p>

      <p>Kybele continued to have a long reach in Asia as well. This silver <br>
      and gold disc comes from Ai Khanum in Afghanistan, and shows<br>
      Kybele and another goddess, perhaps Nike, in the lion chariot, with<br>
      sun, moon, and Venus in thesky and a Persian magus at right.</p>

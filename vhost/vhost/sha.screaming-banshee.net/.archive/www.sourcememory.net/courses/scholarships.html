      <p><strong>Low-income scholarships for online courses</strong></p>
      <p>If you are low-income, you can subscribe at a lower rate per month, suggested amount $21. <br />
        <br />
        Use the  Donate button on the <a href="/courses/prepay.html">PrePay page</a>, and enter your amount. You don't have to pay more than one month in advance, and can keep renewing by using this button. <br />
        <br />
        If you don't have credit cards, you can send a check or money order made out to Max Dashu (see <a href="http://www.sourcememory.net/courses/prepay.html">Prepay page</a> for details), though it will take longer to enroll you. Please don't send cash in the mail. </p>
      <p><strong>Who qualifies for the scholarships:</strong></p>
      <p>I am a strong believer in sliding scale. However, this has presented difficulties as people with higher incomes often try to claim the low end of the scale, while those who are struggling will try to pay higher than they can afford, because they are embarrassed to ask, aren't sure they qualify, or because they know that my work is severely underfunded and desire to support feminist history. </p>
      <p>If you earn a professional salary, travel abroad, own your own home or a new car, get money or property from parents, husband, or partner, have paid vacations and other benefits, eat out often, or (especially) pay for other classes at higher rates, you do not qualify for the scholarship.</p>
      <p>Those who truly qualify (usually the most reluctant to ask) are most welcome to subscribe by scholarship. You are who it is for.</p>
      <p>I have zero  desire to investigate peopleâ€™s incomes, but reserve the right to refuse scholarships to people who don't qualify. The scholarships depend on honesty and fair dealing, as well as on valuing women's work and understanding of how much work is involved. So please vote for the change you want to see in the world.</p>

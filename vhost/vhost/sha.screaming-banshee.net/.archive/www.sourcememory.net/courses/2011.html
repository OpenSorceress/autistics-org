	font: 100% Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
	background: #666666;
	margin: 0; /* it's good practice to zero the margin and padding of the body element to account for differing browser defaults */

/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust based on your final font sizing.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #container { 
	width: 46em;  /* this width will create a container that will fit in an 800px browser window if text is left at browser default font sizes */
	background: #FFFFFF;
	margin: 0 auto; /* the auto margins (in conjunction with a width) center the page */
	border: 1px solid #000000;
	text-align: left; /* this overrides the text-align: center on the body element. */
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #header {
	padding: 0 10px;  /* this padding matches the left alignment of the elements in the divs that appear beneath it. If an image is used in the #header instead of text, you may want to remove the padding. */
	background-color: #FFCC66;
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #header h1 {
	margin: 0; /* zeroing the margin of the last element in the #header div will avoid margin collapse - an unexplainable space between divs. If the div has a border around it, this is not necessary as that also avoids the margin collapse */
	padding: 10px 0; /* using padding instead of margin will allow you to keep the element away from the edges of the div */
}

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. Be aware that if you set a font-size value on this div, the overall width of the div will be adjusted accordingly.
2. Since we are working in ems, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar itself. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
3. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
*/
.twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 {
	float: left;
	width: 12em; /* the background color will be displayed for the length of the content in the column, but no further */
	padding: 15px 0; /* top and bottom padding create visual space within this div */
	background-color: #FFFFCC;
}
.twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 h3, .twoColElsLtHdr #sidebar1 p {
	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */
	margin-right: 10px;
}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. If you give this #mainContent div a font-size value different than the #sidebar1 div, the margins of the #mainContent div will be based on its font-size and the width of the #sidebar1 div will be based on its font-size. You may wish to adjust the values of these divs.
2. The space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
3. To avoid float drop, you may need to test to determine the approximate maximum image/element size since this layout is based on the user's font sizing combined with the values you set. However, if the user has their browser font size set lower than normal, less space will be available in the #mainContent div than you may see on testing.
4. In the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs that may occur.

	background:#DDDDDD;
} 
.twoColElsLtHdr #footer p {
	margin: 0; /* zeroing the margins of the first element in the footer will avoid the possibility of margin collapse - a space between divs */
	padding: 10px 0; /* padding on this element will create space, just as the the margin would have, without the margin collapse issue */

    <h2 class="style9 style13">Spiritual Heritages of Ancient Europe</h2>
    <p>We'll  retrace what can be reconstructed of goddess reverence,  sacred dance, chant, and female rituals; of women as seers, healers, and priestessses. We also track an interwoven strand: patriarchal demotion and repression of women's power. This  first course centers on  ancient southern and western Europe, surveying  archaeology, the written record,  legal codes, art, linguistic evidence, and folklore. We'll use images and excerpts from my forthcoming book <em>Secret History of the Witches</em>,  with  discussion (see left panel). </p>

    (T</span><span class="style3">he order may change, and we will spend more time than one week on some  topics. )</span></h2>
    <p>I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Searching for Diana</strong> and other ancient Italian goddesses: Ops, Uni, Bona Dea, Feronia, Ceres</p>
    <p>II&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Women's Mysteries</strong> in a patriarchal context. Hecate, Circe, Medea, and Greek witches. Fenta Fauna, the Bona Dea, appropriation and repression</p>
    <p>III&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>What about Danu?</strong> Mothers of the waters, and the Tuatha Dé Danann. Broad Indo-European patterns, river goddesses, and linguistic perplexes. </p>
    <p>IV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Banfaith, druidae</strong>, and  seeresses of ancient Eire, Gaul, and Britain</p>
    <p>V&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Celtic Goddesses</strong> in the Roman era:  Healing springs. Serpents, horses, deer, bears, dogs, and ducks. Altars to the Matronae, Epona, Sirona, Rosmerta, and many others.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>VI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Goddesses in Irish literature </strong>and folk tradition: Anu, mother of the gods. Morrigan, Macha, Babd. Bóand. Buí. Eriu, Fodla, Banba. Flidais. Medb.</p>
    <p>And more to be determined, hopefully we'll have time to go into early medieval Pagan tradition and church-state repression ...<br />

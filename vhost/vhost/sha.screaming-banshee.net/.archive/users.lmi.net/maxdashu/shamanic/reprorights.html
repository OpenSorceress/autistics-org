      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="4">A woman has a right to decide whether and how she will 
          bear children. Forcing her to go through pregnancy and birth against 
          her will is an assault on her humanity. She&#8217;s not a machine; it 
          is her body and life that are at stake, and bringing a child into the 
          world falls to her responsibility. Every woman has a right to physical 
          integrity, safety, and the dignity of self-determination.<br>
          <br>
          Criminalizing abortion (or birth control) is no help to &#8220;the family&#8221; 
          when its members&#8217; health and economic survival are threatened, 
          and working mothers&#8217; access to childcare is extremely limited.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4"> Restricting teen women&#8217;s access to birth control 
          information and methods results in millions of immature mothers without 
          partners or job skills. Ideologues who want to bar teens&#8217; access 
          to sex education and birth control are also blocking information about 
          safer sex practices that prevent the spread of HIV-AIDS and other sexually 
          transmitted diseases. Some, such as HPV, can later cause cervical cancer 
          to develop. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Poor and young mothers' lack of access to medical care 
          and perinatal support services leads to a shockingly high infant mortality 
          rate (and maternal mortality too) among some US communities.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Many women of color and disabled women have been subjected 
          to forced sterilization and medical experimentation without informed 
          consent in the past four decades. Government agencies have even imposed 
          risky methods like Norplant hormonal implants on women as a condition 
          for receiving benefits.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">But even rich and white and able-bodied women are subjected 
          to unnecessary hysterectomies and Caesarian sections, whose rates have 
          escalated dramatically in recent years. The ability to schedule deliveries 
          may be convenient for doctors, but they don&#8217;t tell the women that 
          hospitals will then oblige them to have Caesareans for all later births. 
          (the surgery weakens the abdominal wall, especially when only one layer 
          of flesh is sutured, as is now common).</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Imprisoned mothers have no recourse to criminal neglect 
          of their medical needs. Some are forced to give birth in shackles; most 
          are deprived of contact with their babies after birth. These mothers 
          are also separated from their other children, and often permanently 
          stripped of custody&#8212;even though many are in prison because of 
          attempts to provide for those children. </font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Another group of mothers who are treated as subhumans 
          without rights are &#8220;surrogate&#8221; mothers. Their economic need 
          (and sometimes their generosity) leads to essential sale of their maternal 
          entitlements, ferociously enforced by surrogacy contract law.</font></p>
        <p><font size="4">Violence against women has a huge impact on reproductive 
          rights. Abusive partners often escalate their battering when a woman 
          becomes pregnant, often targeting their punches and kicks to her belly. 
          Rape, whether by strangers, boyfriends or relatives, creates an especially 
          urgent need to terminate a pregnancy. Girls are the group least likely 
          to be able to access abortions for rape-pregnancies. The limitations 
          proposed in many states would legally subject girls to the consent of 
          an incestuous father. </font></p>

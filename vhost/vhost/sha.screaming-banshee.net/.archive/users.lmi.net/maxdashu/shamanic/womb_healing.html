<p align="center"><font size="4">Tantric invocation of the Goddess  abiding inthe first chakra:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="5">Within in reigns Paraa, the Awakener of eternal 
  knowledge<br>
  She is the omnipotent Kalaa who is wonderfully skillful <br>
  to create, and is subtler than the subtlest.<br>
  She is the receptacle of the continuous stream of ambrosia<br>
  which flows from the eternal bliss.<br>
  By her radiance it is that the whole of this universe<br>
  and this cauldron is illumined.</font></p>
<p align="center">--Mahanirvana Tantra</p>
<p align="center"><b>Womb Healing</b> focuses on the second chakra, <br>
  described as a six-petalled lotus in which <br>
  a half moon rests like the autumnal moon:</p>
<p align="center"><font size="5">It is here that Rakini always shines.<br>
  Her radiant beauty equals the center of the blue lotus.<br>
  The beauty of her body is enhanced by <br>
  her uplifted arms holding various weapons.<br>
  She is dressed in celestial raiment and ornaments,<br>
  and her mind is exalted with the drinking of ambrosia.</font></p>
<p align="center">And tthe fourth chakra, called Anahata, 
  the Unstruck Sound, <br>
  where the blissful form of Goddess manifests <br>
  &quot;and is experienced by the inward-turned mind of the blessed ones, <br>
  whose hair stands on end and whose eyes weep for joy.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><font size="5">The Shakti whose tender body is like <br>
  ten million flashes of lightning<br>
  is in the center of this lotus as a triangle. <br>
  (Inside the triangle is the Yoni (origin/ vulva) <br>
  like shining gold and on it an orifice <br>
  as tiny as that in a gem -- the Bindu -- <br>
  the resplendent abode of Lakshmi. </font><font size="5"><br>
  This heart lotus is beautified by the Hamsa, <br>
  which is like the steady tapering flame <br>
  of a lamp in a windless place.</font></p>

The Waters of Life well up on         one side, the healing Waters of Death on the other. Seven planes exist         within the Tree, some deep in the Underworld, others reaching into the         Heavens. Shamans learn to attain these states through ecstatic chant and         dance. Having journeyed through the worlds, a woman dances atop the Tree.         </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p align="center"><a href="../deasophy/deasophy.html">Deasophy</a> |<a href="../kindreds/kin_portals.html">         Kindreds</a> |<a href="../orders.html"> Order</a></p>      <p align="center"><font color="#6699FF">All Art Copyright 2000 Max Dashu</font></p></td>  </tr></table><p align="center"><font size="5">At the very top of the cape, high, facing the   waters<br>  </font><font size="5">And consorting with black whirlwinds <br>  Onely grew the many-branched Tree of Happiness, <br>  With raised roots, with slightly rubbed bark, <br>  With bare branches and top bent askew. <br>  To the eastern hill from the end of a cone <br>  A foamy moisture flew to Earth with a willow ptarmigan<br>  Like wisps of hair from horses' tails and manes<br>  Gathered in a bunch, trailed far-flung silken needles.<br>  The foam, in drops as large as a ptarmigan, flowed forever.<br>  From the westward point of its branches in an endless stream<br>  Foam oozed on the holy Earth.<br>  This stream, three hand-spans deep, dug deep in Earth Mother<br>  And of pure milk formed a lake.<br>  Nourished with the juices of this tree<br>  </font><font size="5">Bathed in its enlivening flow, the weak grow strong<br>  They grow, the small filled out, the sickly were made whole.<br>  For the happiness of the living, such was the purpose<br>  Of that created blessed</font><font size="5"> regal Tree.</font></p><p align="center"><font size="5">---Archiv Yakutskovo Filiala: Lenskiye Pensni</font></p><p align="center"><font size="5">from an olonkho (epic poem) of the Yakut people   <br>  of the Lena River in eastern Siberia<br>  </font></p></body></html>

Even after Goddess         veneration was driven underground, her sign continued to be revered by         Jews, Christians and Muslims, who still wear it in protective amulets.         It has appeared in Christian art in Egypt, Hannukah candelabras in Iraq,         and Muslim processional staffs in India. The name Hamsa means &quot;five&quot;         in Arabic. Muslims also call this sign the“Hand of Fatima,” in honor of         Muhammad’s daughter. The Hamsa’s ancient origins represent commonality         across modern divisions, a blessing with unifying potential. This Hamsa         is inscribed Tzedek, Shutafut, Shalom: Hebrew for &quot;Justice, Partnership,         Peace.&quot; </font></p>      <p><font size="3">(Card color: Black on golden-tan parchment)<a name="tanit"></a></font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p align="right"><img src="tanit.gif" width="252" height="198" align="right"><font size="6">Hand         of Tanit </font></p>      <p><font size="4">Carthage, Tunisia The blessing hand of the goddess Tanit         came to north Africa with the Phoenicians. Their Canaanite cousins also         revered this symbol and the dove which was sacred to Atargatis in Syria,         Astarte in Palestine, and Aphrodite in Cyprus. In ancient Tunisia, limestone         stelas combine the blessing hand with palm trees, horned pillars, and         an abstract triangular image of Tanit with her arms raised in benediction.         Late Carthaginian and Egyptian art continue to portray women with one         hand raised in the gesture of benediction.</font></p>      <p align="center"><font size="3">(Card color: black on peach)</font></p>      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="center"><a href="../shamanic/shaman_sanc.html">Shamanic</a> |         <a href="../deasophy/deasophy.html">Deasophy</a> | <a href="../kindreds/kin_portals.html">Kindreds</a>         |<a href="../orders.html"> Order</a></p>      <p align="center">Copyright 2000 Max Dashu </p>      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>      </td>  </tr></table><p align="center">&nbsp;</p></body></html>

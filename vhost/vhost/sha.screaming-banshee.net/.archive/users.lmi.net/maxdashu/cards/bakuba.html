Traditional histories refer to female chiefs         like Ruwej of the BaLunda and Mwadi Kapuk of the Ampimin. The Amalas,         Amatab and Anzanang were originally governed by women. Some BaLunda titles         show that offices now held only by men were once filled by women: Mwad         Mwish, First Female Pillar; Mwad Chilab, First Courageous Woman; and Runkonkish         wa Mpat, who oversaw chief selection. This lady is swathed in Kasai velvets,         the raffia pile cloth that BaKuba women embroider with rich patterns.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><img src="karagasy.gif" width="107" height="200" align="right" hspace="20"></p>      <p align="right"><font size="6">Karagasy Shaman <a name="karagasy"></a></font></p>      <p><font size="4">Ecstatic priestesses were active across the central Asian         steppes and the far reaches of north Asia. A Siberian proverb declares,         &quot;Woman is by nature a shaman,&quot; and the Buryat Mongols say that         the first shaman was a woman. Epics of the Turks, Tatars and Manchus sang         of the exploits of female shamans, like the maiden Kubaiko who descended         to the underworld to rescue her slain brother. This central Asian priestess         has painted her visions on the sacred drum by which she journeys across         the worlds. </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p align="left"><img src="kwakiutl.gif" width="124" height="225" align="left" hspace="20"><font size="6">Kwakiutl         Chieftain<a name="kwakiutl"></a> </font></p>      <p><font size="4">In the mass of disinformation about Indian nations, most         books omit records of women leaders such as Wetamu, Aliquippa, Nanyehi,         Lozen, and Awashonks. There were women chieftains on the Columbia river.         In California the eastern Pomo had female chiefs called da-halik. The         Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) and the Dineh (Navajo) still have powerful councils         of women elders active today. This image appeared in a turn-of -the-century         US government ethnology bulletin bearing only the designation &quot;Kwakiutl         Chieftainess.&quot;</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>      <p align="right"><img src="lahuna.gif" width="124" height="252" align="right" hspace="20"><font size="6">Lahu         Na Dancer <a name="lahu"></a></font></p>      <p><font size="4">Some hill peoples of Thailand and Yunnan are matrilineal         and matrilocal, such as the Karen, Musuo and Nakhi. Women head Musuo families,         and couples are free to form <b>azhu</b> (&quot;friendly&quot;) spousals.         Clan priestesses lead ceremonies of their Daba religion, whose major deity         is the goddess Ganmu. The Lahu peoples reckon descent in both female and         male lines. Their young women often take the initiative in courting male         visitors, and legend explains why the men participate in childcare and         fetching water and firewood. This Lahu Na woman is celebrating the New         Year in festival dress, with a mouth organ in hand. </font></p>      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>    </td>  </tr></table><p align="center">Copyright 2000 Max Dashu </p><p align="center"><a href="../shamanic/shaman_sanc.html">Shamanic</a> | <a href="../deasophy/deasophy.html">Deasophy</a>   | <a href="../kindreds/kin_portals.html">Kindreds</a> | <a href="../orders.html">Order</a></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p></body></html>
